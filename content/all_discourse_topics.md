Don’t take TDS, this subject should be taken in the end else you might have some problem

I missed the end-term exam due to an urgent emergency.

The grading assignment indicates I’m NOT eligible for a final score. Does that mean this subject wont be considered at all for the final course card?

Can I still take the end-term exam and be excused from submitting the assignments and projects?

I still got the assignments though, I can complete those, but I am not sure the new ones will be considered for evaluation, please clarify

For question 16 of GA1, It says "Rename all files replacing each digit with the next "  
Accepted answer is working only if file names are renamed as  
2h3q9x.txt → 3h4q0x.txt  
eb209nmlca.txt → eb310nmlca.txt  
That means if digit is 9 then next digit should be 0. [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) let me know if this is what is expected. since 9->10 or 209 → 210 is not working

Hi anant,

Question mentions every digit should be replaced by next one.

In that case 209 would get replaced by 310

Here in question, it’s mentioned to replace every digit with next digit, that’s why 209 would be 310.

Hi manmeet,

I don’t know about solution to this.  
Some network setting might be causing problem.

Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.

I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.

2 days ago I attempted TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development Tools and scored 8.5. I didn’t submit as I wanted to attempt incorrect answer questions.  
When I logged in today it says score is 0.  
Shall I submit or not? Do I have to attempt all questions again?  
Why the assignment and submissions are two separate pages/links?  
If [seek] ([Nptel Seekh](https://seek.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/courses/ns_25t1_se2002)) can access [TDS exam] ([Technical Assessment](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1)) then why we need to submit from seek?

The seek portal question is to confirm that the student has seen the GA. It does not actually give you a score. Otherwise students sometimes claim that they looked and did not find any GAs (this has happened in the past). Hence the two stage verification. You still need to ![Screenshot 2025-01-13 at 12.50.02](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/6/d67654c30e9fe72ff5970775fa393eaec8204779.png) the submissions to get a score for the GA.

The actual GA questions are on <https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/> via the seek portal or  
on the [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/) introduction page.

Its just a more robust way of ensuring that students have indeed viewed the GAs.

As far your submission goes, we have your last submission and the score. ![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:")

We will check on our end why your submission has not reloaded into your browser.  
Normally these are stored in session storage. So if your browser has deleted them, it might have not loaded from our back end server. [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) will be able to confirm the reason for this problem.

**For the time being if you are making a fresh submission, just fill in all the answers in again, so that your latest submission will be marked correctly.**

Hi [@Nelson](/u/nelson)

Your answers on the [exam](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/) site that have been submitted will be saved and used as the basis for your score. Saying yes/no on seek does not materially impact scoring. Its just an awareness question. Even if you answered yes on the seek portal, you can still revise your answers on the exam site. The final submission is always whats locked in for the score (until the deadline passes).

Kind regards

It might be because you are not adding up the correct tags with attribute `data-value`. There may be other tags within the same DOM and having the attribute `data-value`.

Hi Shouvik,

Your code seems correct to me. I think there is an extra space before your answer in input box.

Btw instead of using a while loop, there is a much more optimal, which uses difference of dates and doesn’t require a loop at all. Try to figure it out.

kind regards

Try copy pasting exact symbols `— OR † OR €` Can you share code in code block, it’s difficult to read symbols that are present.

Also have a look at what `all_content` variable contains, see if there are some problem with content.

```

        <div class="bar baz" data-value="17">
          <div class="baz foo" data-value="29"></div>
          <div class="foo" data-value="20"></div>

In all the video lectures, I am first required to download the tools, install them on my computer ? Is it not going to overload my computer’s RAM etc.,  
In one of the classes, you said that there is something - colab like cloud wherein we can go and practice without overloading our own computers. Will you please let me know how to go about it ??

how to calculate How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1981-08-30 to 2017-07-17?

The dates are in the year-month-day format. Include both the start and end date in your count. You can do this using any tool (e.g. Excel, Python, JavaScript, manually).

[@23f2005067](/u/23f2005067) [@23f2003751](/u/23f2003751) I added a “Recent saves” feature.

This will show the time and score for the last 3 times you saved. You can load from any of these.

[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/e/ce7bbb617fc5997babd5910bd19e8ac3f9c3fe07.png)image368×152 5.35 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/e/ce7bbb617fc5997babd5910bd19e8ac3f9c3fe07.png "image")

Do remember to click the “Check” button to calculate your score. That is not automatic.

Please check this out and let me know if there are any bugs. Thanks.

If you are on windows, you might not be able to use sha256sum.

Here are two disussions that might help you out.

[@Rohitkumar7463](/u/rohitkumar7463) [@23f2003845](/u/23f2003845)

If you are on Windows Powershell  
Then instead of `sha256sum` you can simply use `Get-FileHash`

Send the output of the `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md` to a text file eg. `output.txt` and then use `Get-FileHash` on powershell with the `output.txt` and it will use sha256 by default and give you the exact same output.  
You might be able to pipe the data directly to `Get-FileHash` but I have not tried direct piping. The above method works guaranteed.

Kind regards

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) Sir

as you said in the previous post, the evaluation script is also updated based on errors other students point out.

I am submitting my answers as soon as the GA is released and stopping once I get 10/10.

Will you reevaluate the answers once the deadline is over? Or the marks I see right now will be set in stone?

If you will, then it will be based on the updated evaluation script which can reduce my marks.

I got the file which needs to be processed to answer the question

I can solve this now using pandas.

From learning perspective, is this question aimed at making students to use something like awk or is it fine if i can carry on with pandas?

[@23f2000573](/u/23f2000573) You can solve it with any tool you’re comfortable with, including pandas.

But since you *already* know how to do it with pandas, I suggest you explore how to do it with something like `awk` (or any other tool) to get a broader exposure into different approaches.

[@Rohitkumar7463](/u/rohitkumar7463) The hash code is exactly what you see under the column Hash,

7E…E5

Thats the Hash code for the file output.txt

A Hash is a *nearly* unique representation of some data within some range dependent on the type of hashing algorithm and the amount of unique pieces of data that need to be encoded. (just my colloquial definition of it, i am sure you are able to ask GPT to give you a much better explanation)

**Time Zone Issues with the “List Files and Attributes” Question**

quick heads‐up about Question 15 (the one asking for files at least 8143 bytes, modified on or after Sun, 19 Nov 2006, 7:38 am GMT‑5). I’m physically in a different time zone, but I eventually discovered the question seems to expect you to be located in India and to interpret that files date/time accordingly.  
I got the correct answer once i localized the files timestamp to IST.

Hi Arnav,

I tried your script on your dataset.  
Problem might be you are not executing `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` in correct directory, you would need to execute it from `all_files` directory also there should not be any extra file other than that gets generated.

Time of modification of each of these files is 14 Jan 2025 which might be the day you unzipped them. Depending upon what software you use it might change modification date while unzipping. use unzip command line tool or winrar extractor, these are 2 tools we have tested.

Hi Saravanan,

I noticed an issue with your submission. In the question, there is a name `Bob`, but it doesn’t appear in your answer after applying the required sorting. Since the data for each student is dynamically generated and unique, the answer you submitted seems inconsistent with your dataset.

We encourage collaboration among students, but copying answers is not acceptable. Instead, I suggest reaching out to your friend to understand the script they used, run it on your dataset, and ensure you fully grasp the solution.

kind regards

I ran this directly in the console and got the correct answer.

// Select all

and  elements with the ‘foo’ class  
const fooElements = document.querySelectorAll(“div.foo, span.foo”);

// Initialize a variable to store the sum  
let sum = 0;

// Iterate through the selected elements  
fooElements.forEach(element => {  
// Get the ‘data-value’ attribute and convert it to a number  
const value = parseFloat(element.getAttribute(“data-value”));

// Add the value to the sum  
if (!isNaN(value)) {  
sum += value;  
}  
});

console.log(“Sum of data-value attributes:”, sum);

Check the structure of your json object. It should be {key1: value1, key2: value2}. Also make sure you enclose the keys and values in double-quotes, and after every key-value pair put a comma.

Your format seems to be correct, but cause you are still facing that problem then these are the few reasons I can think of

1. Check the entire JSON object and make sure that each and every element follows this format.
2. Use Chrome for getting that hash code, it could be the case that some other browser may not be pasting the object as intended.

Hello Sir,  
I am writing to bring to your attention a discrepancy I’ve noticed regarding my Week 1 graded assignment for the Tools in Data Science course.

I successfully completed the assignment and received a score of **80 out of 100**. However, when I checked the course portal, it is showing my status as “**absent**” for this particular assignment.

I wanted to ensure that this information is corrected in the system to accurately reflect my participation and performance. Could you please look into this matter and update my grade accordingly?

Check your browser console most probably CORS is causing problem.

Try adding CORS to your code it might work.

Kind regards

Hi Mishkat,

Please use triple backticks to encapsulate code, so that we can debug your code more easily.

eg

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
   print ("Hello")

```

Please use this discourse etiquette to share code.

Thanks and kind regards

Hi Mishkat,

This error is because you are filtering on `class_` instead of `class`

So if you send a request on `http://127.0.0.1/api?class_=1S` you will see response for that `1S` class only.

kind regards

Hi Guddu,

Inside `index.html` file of your repo, don’t put html code just put your email in the file nothing else.

This issue is because when you deploy on github pages it encrypts any email that’s on page.

kind regards.

I am facing an issue with Docker Desktop.

[![Docker Desktop Error](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/7/d7bcf7a2f709561b98fa8bde031ab5d1e81a4a0d.png)Docker Desktop Error558×377 27 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/7/d7bcf7a2f709561b98fa8bde031ab5d1e81a4a0d.png "Docker Desktop Error")

I have uninstalled and installed Docker (run as administrator).

Tried many solutions after googling for the issue.  
So far no solution. Anyone else faced this issue and found a solution?

Hi Telvin,

Try opening `localhost:8080` in browser if that works, if it opens in browser then issue might be with some network configurations.

I solved this question in github codespace, which didn’t require me to make any changes in network.

[@Nelson](/u/nelson) I would recommend [Podman](https://podman.io/) or [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) rather than [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

Docker Desktop is [not free for organizations over 250 people](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/desktop-license/) and many organizations have therefore moved away from it.

[@22f2001640](/u/22f2001640) in that case

* a firewall or local security settings might block access to port 8080, or
* a network restriction is blocking access to port 8080

Please try one of these:

* Try the same on a personal laptop on a public / home network
* GitHub codespaces, as [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) suggested

You *could* try an ngrok alternative like [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/) but I don’t think that’ll work.

Hi Mishkat,

The GA url encoded parameter is `class`  
In your screenshot, you are using `class_`  
Your code that we examined earlier also accepts `class_` as the parameter instead of `class` as required by the GA  
The GA will test your deployment by sending it a request with the url encoded parameter `class`

Hi Mishkat,

In your code, the word `class` is a reserved keyword in python. So simply changing `class_` to `class` is not going to work. The *only* thing you need to change is the keyword accepted by the api *not* the variable name used inside your function. Hope that helps you narrow down the problem.

Kind regards

For GA - 2 , Question 6:

And It is working fine gives correct json response as expected in browser.

But When I try to that on portal It gives me “CORS Missing Allow Origin” Error.

I have added “Access-Control-Allow-Origin” as “\*” for allowing request from any origin.

I get the correct response in browser but it fails in quiz portal.  
Can anyone please suggest what exactly I am missing here.

Hi Aindree,

I tried to send a request to your application `https://your-app2.vercel.app/api` with url encoded parameter `class=7Q`. It should fetch marks of that particular class. But in response it sends `{"marks": []}`.

Check if your csv file is correct. Also check if code is correct.

Kind regards

For the questions such as cors, llm i have to locally run the code and submit it.After a while if i have to submit it again the prev url that i have submitted is throwing an error. Maybe becaue it is checking the url again at the time of submission. Fix this issue, the similar issue lies with the image compression problem. when i upload the code and checks and submits it at that time i got the marks but after sometime if i make the change in some other question the file that i uploaded prev is nowhere to found.so please fix this issue

Hi Tushar,

For questions which require submitting a url, when you click on save button all those server’s should be running.

For that image uploading question one solution would be to keep image in a particular directory, and then upload from there every time you make a submission.

Kind regards  
Jivraj

For the Q.2 on image compression, for PNG, SVG or WEBP files, I’m getting the error “Could not process image. Is it browser supported image? Image pixels do not match the original” (I believe the last part is not applicable as the image was not processed ). Visually, I could not find any difference between the two files and the size of new file is less than 1,500 bytes.

Tried through Chrome v132.0.6834.83 without any add-ons/extensions.

[@23f2003751](/u/23f2003751)  
While I understand why you might choose to use `flask` due to your familiarity with it,  
the `http.server` library is just very simple to use.

The **only extra line of code** you would need inside your `get` request if you used the `http.server` library would be:

`self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")`

Try to rewrite your code using `http.server` library so that your debugging for simple tasks like this is easy.

The boilerplate code for a `get` request using the `http.server` library was already given in Q6. So you have to do very minimal modifications to it and it works like a charm.

Kind regards

[@23F300327](/u/23f300327) You would have to be a bit more specific on what exactly is the nature of your error on your machine.

GA2 - Q6 has no dependency on the OS or your computer. It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems.

Now typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly.

Also the live sessions on [youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_h5u1jMeBCl1BquBhgunA4t08XAxsA-C&si=NE4LEQe48XfzAYbc) will address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing.

There will be session 2025-01-20T14:30:00Z→2025-01-20T16:30:00Z which will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries.

The session is in your course calendar and the meet link is [meet.google.com/baz-ayij-ziy](http://meet.google.com/baz-ayij-ziy)

[@23F300327](/u/23f300327)

Typically for a vercel application, and in particular for GA2-Q6, the applications are basically function calls. You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code.

When a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api  
with parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request.

The rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel’s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program.

That’s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this

```
# api/index.py
import json
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler

class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type','application/json')
        self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(json.dumps({"message": "Hello!"}).encode('utf-8'))
        return

```

Notice there is no `if __name__ == "__main__":` code block.  
This would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application.

`if __name__ == "__main__":` is used to execute some code **only** if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application.

Try rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default `handler` class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared.

Another possible problem:  
By default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues [TDS > Development Tools > unicode](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/unicode)

So converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it.

Let us know what worked. We are all learning from each other.

Kind regards

I’m not sure of the exact reason for the issue, but there are different ways to deploy to Vercel. One approach is using a `vercel.json` configuration file, and another is adding headers directly in the API code.

You can follow [Gui Bibeau’s guide](https://www.frontend-devops.com/blog/python-on-vercel) to add CORS headers to your deployment setup. Also check the recording from yesterday’s session for more clarity in that session Carlton deployed application directly from github repository. If you’re still facing issues, you can join today’s session at 9 PM.

For deploying a Flask or FastAPI app to Vercel, refer to [this guide on DEV Community](https://dev.to/andrewbaisden/how-to-deploy-a-python-flask-app-to-vercel-2o5k). I’ve tried both methods, and they work well.

From image that you have shared, it explains ngrok tunnel that you are submitting in answer is not running.

For any assignment if it involves running some server then you would need to keep all the server’s running when you submit

Hi Naman,

error code 524 is generally because of timeout in response, one thing you can check is if there is load on Llama server as information that I got by a google search [Error 524: A Timeout Occurred (What It Is & How to Fix It)](https://www.lifewire.com/error-524-a-timeout-occurred-4782741). I tried submitting now while replying at 2:45 am it was working fine.

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) Is there any problem from our end, such as tds hosting server receiving lots of traffic on website.

Hi Srividhya,

This error is because you are trying to access a feature of ngrok which requires to pay [ERR\_NGROK\_501 | ngrok documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs/errors/err_ngrok_501/#:~:text=Only%20Personal%2C%20Pro%2C%20Enterprise%2C%20or%20Pay-as-you-go%20accounts%20can,resolving%20this%20error%2C%20please%20reach%20out%20to%20support%40ngrok.com).

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) Hello Sir, I’m also using Squoosh. The pixel size of the resulting image is 800 x 600 and the file size is 1,473 bytes. The steps I used to create the solution image:

1. Open Squoosh and load the image
2. In the dropdown in “Compress” section, select “OxiPNG”. Left the other options unchanged (Interlace checkbox is unchecked, Effort is at 2).
3. The resulting image is downloaded which has same pixel size as original image but file size is 1,473 bytes

I also tried WebP with “Lossless” option selected and “Effort” increased to 9. This gives even smaller filesize at just 630 bytes. However, even that image is not accepted. The selected options for WebP are in the screenshot below.

[@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382)

Nothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat.

That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”.

Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials!

So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done.

In the meanwhile:

There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything.

Kind regards

Once i close my local llm and close the nrgrok URL (after entering the answer and the answer being correct), the next time I refresh or check the answer in the Ga2 site, q10 gets marked wrong. I have to redo the entire process for it to be correct again.

Can you clarify why this is happening?

because it dynamically checks the answer each time a submit is done and if the ngrok tunnel and the service is not running at the time, then it marks it wrong.

Since every student’s answer is going to be unique (unlike a mathematics question), by necessity we have to dynamically check the answer each submit.

The workaround to prevent having to do it all over again, is to simply check all your answers that do not need active running servers first, then before doing a final save, run the servers for the required questions and the ngrok tunnel and submit to get the full marks.

Just dont forget that your last save is what gets graded. Just ignore for now once you got it working. Solve all the other ones first and then for the final submission “get all your ducks in a row.”

Kind regards

hi [@23f2003853](/u/23f2003853)

I think you are running your application server inside a virtual machine because of which it doesn’t have visibility to outside world(request coming from other domains). So you would need to identify ipaddress of your virtual machine and would need to use that in place of `127.0.0.1`. Take help from GPT to identify ipaddress of virtual machine.

Hello Sir,

I’ve been working on question 6 and I’m facing this error where the marks are not ordered properly. I believe my code appends the marks based on the names that are inputted in the backend but I’m unable to identify the source of this issue. Please shed some light on the same.

Hi Shalini,

I deployed my code with your dataset and checked and checked answers for your dataset, so there is no errors in backend.

Since you are getting some output, it won’t help to look up to logs from vercel, just check your code if it’s logically correct.

Kind regards  
Jivraj

I think in Q.6 its some error in your code’s logic its unable to fetch the data from your code(Even I tried your URL and its just a black page). Make sure your link is working correctly(giving json response) by pasting it to the browser.

In Q9. I have created dictionary of given data. You can check the for format in the given codes just above the question.(see Test with curl api)

I think your code logic seem to be correct but it may be because u have downloaded twice the same image and in your output lenna.webp is saving to lenna(1).webp.  
Try to do it again after deleting those images which are already downloaded!

Hi [@24ds1000082\_Vivek](/u/24ds1000082_vivek) ,

I don’t see any difference between them. Can you share screen shot of browser console tab and Network tab. Also join tomorrow’s session towards ending of each session we use to take doubts.

[@23F3002987\_J\_SRI\_BAL](/u/23f3002987_j_sri_bal) ,

This must be a production deployment url, that’s why I am not able to access it.

[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/f/6/f6ae861370f12370cde76d18de318ad1fc622d2d_2_690x330.png)image1822×874 43.7 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/6/f6ae861370f12370cde76d18de318ad1fc622d2d.png "image")

Solution :

Go to vercel dashboard and select your project, and below domains you would find a url use that.

[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/e/a/ea1a1dadad49d6b6665a2366d0902d4a45122b32_2_690x317.png)image1709×787 66.9 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/e/a/ea1a1dadad49d6b6665a2366d0902d4a45122b32.png "image")

If this doesn’t solve problem, pls join tomorrow’s session between 8-10 towards ending of session we use to take doubts.

The issue might be with the IP address you’re using. Try using `127.0.0.1` and check if it’s the correct localhost IP for your machine. Also, test with `http://localhost:8000/api` to see if it works.

If that doesn’t solve the problem and you’re running port 8000 inside a virtual machine, use the `ipconfig` command to check the correct IP address.

We usually address doubts at the end of every session. Our next session is on the 31st—you can join then and ask your question if none of above solutions works.

you need to keep the services running. Else it will fail. Do whats required, regenerate that link and paste it once you complete and save it. this way you can avoid rework.

Hi sakshi in vercel problem i also had similar error. remove this code if **name** == ‘**main**’:

24 # app.run(debug=True) frm your flask app then run it. it worked for me i found this with the help of chatgpt. vercel has some built in features to run so this is not required it seems.

Hi Srividya,

Thats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints.  
When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs.

This renders `name == main` part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it).

In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You *do not* create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2.

This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications.

Thanks for your input.

Kind regards

@ carlton @ Jivraj  
Gentlemen! In GA2 answers, I have a problem.  
Question 10, the ngrok tunnel url was once correct and I saved it . When I revisited the GA2 again, the question 10 was marked incorrect.  
Do I need to do anything else ?  
Secondly the image comression file needs to be reloaded everytime I reconnect to the GA2. When I reload the last saved version, it does not take into the answer already saved.  
Third, the url link as given on publishing the page via github is obviously correct. But on checking, even after ?v = 1 …it does not work. Could you kindly look into them and advise if anything else needs to be done at my end? thanks & regards.

In the ngrok question I was getting that same json error as everybody else since last 7 days or so. The ngrok link was working fine in browser every time but. Today i ran the LLama file with `--n-gpu-layers 35` parameter at the end which makes it run using my laptops graphics card i guess. After i ran LLama file using this and ngrok later, my link was accepted in the GA 2 and i did not get any error after that.  
[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) did this happen because i ran LLama file using my laptop GPU? This was suggested to me by another student who had the same problem.

Try these [@21f3000745](/u/21f3000745)

1. Download the data file once again and replace it with your current file, then deploy.  
   **If this doesn’t work, then:**
2. Try clicking on Check button once again. There are few cases where due to duplicity or other problems in the data, this bug occurs. The next check will most probably work.
3. Reload the page, open the Networks Tab in the Inspect menu, click on Fetch/XHR filter button. Next click on check, if this error prompts up, you will get the request the system sent to check your answer. Copy that request and check on localhost.

Hi [@24DS1000121\_ULAGAOOZ](/u/24ds1000121_ulagaooz) ,

For the **ngrok tunnel** question and any other question requiring a server URL, make sure to **keep all servers running** when clicking the **Save** button.

Also, I couldn’t find the **GitHub Pages URL** in your **GA2 response**, and many answers are unmarked. It seems you **didn’t click the Save button**.

Your current score is **4.5/10**.

Hi [@23f2000573](/u/23f2000573) ,

As error mentions to add tag to image.

Adding different tags is like versioning your docker image, image with a particular tag can be pulled.

For adding tag use

For GA2 there is not question that asks if you visited GA2 page or not.  
Just answer on GA2 page [TDS 2025 Jan GA2 - Deployment Tools](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga2#hq-docker-hub-image).

Hi [@24f1002359](/u/24f1002359)

For **Question 10**, ensure that **all servers are running** every time you submit (click the **Save** button). Since **ngrok generates a new URL each time it runs**, double-check that the **ngrok URL is correct** before submitting.

For **Question 9**, did you **enable CORS**? To verify, check your **browser console**—if CORS is not enabled, you should see an error message indicating the issue.

[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/3/2/329ce069447dd12d66391813c527d25c5d109b2f.png)image724×136 18.3 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/3/2/329ce069447dd12d66391813c527d25c5d109b2f.png "image")

For question 5, I have tried executed script with your set of parameters, your answer is correct. Will discuss it internally.

Hi [@24DS1000121\_ULAGAOOZ](/u/24ds1000121_ulagaooz) ,

That’s because GitHub protects your email when an external website requests a GitHub Page. To disable this protection, create a `.nojekyll` file in your root folder of your repository.

The problem is that, if class param is passed, only then it is filtering as usual, but when no param is passed it returns the entire DataFrame, which is not supposed to happen.

If no parameter is passed it should return an empty list.

I suspect you directly copied this code from ChatGPT without understanding, which is acceptable for us, but not very helpful for you.

If you have saved your answers on the TDS portal then you need not worry, you will be marked. The button was just there to ensure you saw the assignment on the TDS portal.

# Topic No: 161214 - Contribute to My Open-Source LLM Classroom Assignment Evaluator
**Topic Slug**: contribute-to-my-open-source-llm-classroom-assignment-evaluator

## Post by Avinash Shrivastava  - January 06, 2025 20:00:14
**Post ID**: 576033

Dear all,

I’m thrilled to share a project inspired by my experience in the \*Tools in Data Science \* course: [**LLM Classroom Assignment Evaluator**](https://github.com/AvinashShrivastav/LLM_Assignment_Evaluator_GoogleClassroom). This is the basic prototype.

This tool leverages Google APIs and LLMs to automate grading and feedback for Google Classroom assignments, making evaluation faster and more insightful for educators.

A heartfelt thanks to **[@s.anand](/u/s.anand)**, our course instructor, and TAs **[@Carlton](/u/carlton)** and **[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)**, whose guidance on LLM function calling and real-world applications made this project possible.

I’d love to invite contributions from this amazing community to:

* Expand functionality and evaluation models.
* Fix bugs and optimize workflows.
* Improve documentation for broader accessibility.

The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AvinashShrivastav/LLM_Assignment_Evaluator_GoogleClassroom) is open for forks, pull requests, and ideas. I look forward to collaborating with you all!

Update: here is a video explaining the process - <https://youtu.be/xa4zhP-S3NE?feature=shared>  
Best regards,  
Avinash Shrivastava

Hi Avinash,

Thats great work! I am glad you were able to use what you learnt from the course for something so practical. I hope you continue to develop and refine it, take feedback from the stakeholders who would be interested in this approach. I see a lot of potential in this project.

Kind regards

In ROE , usually you have to find the answers of the questions by solving them using codes and tools explained in the course .

For example you have a large pdf file of some patients and their disease and you are said to find number patients having some XYZ disease in that pdf . Now you can get this answer by using parsing tools and few lines of codes and after getting the results you can write that answer back in the portal .

Same goes for assignments , they will be more like minor project works.

[@Divya1](/u/divya1) there are no IITM certified books nor PDFs for [Tools in Data Science](/c/courses/tds-kb/34). The site <https://tds.s-anand.net/> is the reference.

We update the content regularly. You might want to [track the changes](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/commits/tds-2025-01/) for recent updates.

I recently explored the details of the extra credit project and found the problem statement and its clever framing both fascinating and challenging. While I’m eager to take it on, I feel my current skill set might fall short of the project’s demands. I’m committed to pushing my boundaries and would greatly appreciate your guidance on topics or resources that could help me prepare more effectively during my free time.

I want to ensure I can contribute something meaningful and engaging, even if the outcome isn’t perfect. If there are any recommended readings, practice problems, or areas of focus that you believe would provide a solid foundation for approaching this project, I would be very grateful for your suggestions.

Thank you for considering my request. I’m genuinely excited by the challenge and hope to make the most of this opportunity to learn and grow under your guidance.

Hi Nilay,

In order to make a api call to openai chat completions you are required to send authentication information(openai key) in headers. For first question of GA3 you don’t have to send actual(working) api key, any dummy api key would work(you can put your name, or tds anything works)

kind regards

Hi [@22f3001315](/u/22f3001315) ,

You are almost correct, there are very minor changes that needs to be made.

Take help from Chat GPT or use this documentation which have correct json body [Vision - OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision).

Kind regards

[@nilaychugh](/u/nilaychugh) [@22f3002034](/u/22f3002034)

The API key is available at <https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/>

The instructions on how to use the token is given at [GitHub - sanand0/aiproxy: Authorizing proxy for LLMs](https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy)

You cannot use this token directly with Open AI or any other gpt. These are only valid via the API exposed by the above instructions.

You get a limit of $1. Use with care.

Hi Nilay,

Yes you would need to use `text-embedding-3-small` model of openai for embedding questions.

i have a doubt, while submitting the GA3, both 7th and 8th questions require the API url to be active and connected right, but its not possible as both the URLs use same port, so if we check my 7th question URL is running right now, it’ll show as correct, but then if i run 8th question URL, the 7th question will automatically show the error, **is there any solution to this problem?**

You can run two servers on different port numbers.

Hi Vikash,

I looked at your answers in backend. In answer you submitted response from openai, but you need to submit json object which is required for sending a request to LLM.

Kind regards

You made same mistake here, instead of response use json body that’s required for sending request to LLM.

Why is my score is out of 8.5? It should be 9.5 right?  
It was 9.5 before a reload.

Hi VIKASH,

This problem must be because CORS not enabled or you are running your application inside wsl, if you using WSL then you would need to identify ipaddress of WSL and use it in place of `127.0.0.1`

In the 6th question ,as I open the graded assignment all the time the new question is generated (NUMERICAL DATA) and the previous answer shows as incorrect answer

My doubt is that should I again and again answer the same quetion(6) all the time until the due passes?  
Is there any alternative ways to look after this problem?

## Post by Shalini Saravanan - January 31, 2025 09:20:32

Hello Sir,

I am unable to recieve a proper output for q1 of ga3.  
This is my test message. Its been given in two lines.

![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/6/0/60deb1fe7cda3d6876df481d07803e66d1974e45.png)

The below is my code for the question.

```
import httpx

url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer api_key",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

system_message = "Analyze the input message if it's  GOOD , BAD or NEUTRAL."
user_message = "2 b7 rkS94mn4  AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI G LeeHS"

payload = {
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": system_message},  # System message
        {"role": "user", "content": user_message}       # One user message
    ],
    "temperature": 0.7
}

response = httpx.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)

response.raise_for_status()

result = response.json()

for choice in result["choices"]:
    print("AI Response:", choice["message"]["content"])

```

I tried to put the two test lines as two user messages but received an error stating that the json body must contain only 2 messages with one mandatorily being a system message. With that in mind, i also tried the alternative

`user_message = "2 b7 rkS94mn4 \n AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI G LeeHS"`

The error message i keep receiving is as below.

![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/7/4/740853eca092fd94814c5c4cb8cc4ddb5f10eba3.png)

Kindly advice on how to proceed.

Thanks and Regards

Hi Shalini,

Your `user_message` is incorrect. I looked at your exact GA and it works if you make sure your `user_message` is precisely what is given to you.

Hint: How do you store a multi-line variable in python?

Is it necessary to pay for the OpenAI API key? Is there any other way?

For those who want to experiment with GPT-4o Mini (or other models), [Github Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models) is free. You can explore and compare models, including GPT-4o Mini, DeepSeek R1, and others.

It has rate limits, so you can’t use it in production, but is a good place to prototype applications and experiment with prompts.

Please let me know if you face any problems accessing it.

Q2 LLM Token Cost ,

We have <https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer> , which helps us count tokens in a string, shouldn’t this be a better way than calling the API? However the returned value does not show as correct answer!

**Q4**  
s3 string was given by

```
image_b64 = ""
import base64
with open('/content/TDS_wk3_q4.png', 'rb') as f:
    binary_data = f.read()
    image_b64 = base64.b64encode(binary_data).decode()
data_uri = f"data:image/png;base64,{image_b64}"

```

  
s4 string given by :   

used this [link](https://www.base64-image.de/)  to generate image url  
  
 Then checked them both, they were the same

```
for x,y in zip(s3,s4):
  if (x != y):
    print(x,y)

```

i verified that both were equal but still one gave the wrong answer(python code), while the online converter gave the right one?  
I know i’m missing something, but why?

Try sending an api call to openai.

Check with network tab, you would see the response of api call being made, Compare that with expected output.

Regrading question 8, you would need to check if cors are enabled, check in browser console tab for more.

For question 2, do we have to make the API call to the proxy or openai? If to the proxy, are there any instructions on the page *before* question 2 that would have pointed me in that direction?

there is a problem in question 7 and 8, fast api question, when i click on save, both api calls happens at once at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000/), and i can run fast api app for question 7 or 8 for one only, suppose i check for question 7 it shows correct, also for question 8 i check it shows correct , but when i try to save one of the answer gets incorrected because of simultaneous calls by question 7 and 8 at this address [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

I tried checking the JSON Output in the Networks tab. I am getting error as “Method Not Found”. But, I have allowed POST Method for question 7 as POST method is used in the question. I also tried checking my API by sending a POST request by the same parameters as given by the Website. I am getting the proper response when I give an API request. Can you please help me out here? I have attached the screenshot of the error as Picture -1 and the correct output what I get as Picture-2. Please help me out as I am facing issue for all the API Questions though I am getting the right output. Thank You.

Hi,

I’m sorry if I’m asking an unrelated question, But I’m very confused with the concept of generating the token from <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys>

Could any one suggest the step by step process? I couldn’t able to find that similar question asked by anyone since the conversations are vast.

Please guide me on this. Also do i need to use my personal mail id or iitm mail id for accessing this token

yes you have to use your IITM email id . Use this link and login you will get your token:

The error shows your code is getting wrong answers for the test cases. I looked into your code and noticed that you are using sklearn (I think which is not required in this case). Just get embedding vector for each document content and query by passing a valid POST request to <http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings> with required headers. And, then calculate `similarity_scores` simply using  
\cos(\theta) = \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{|\mathbf{A}| |\mathbf{B}|}  
which in python syntax is-

```
np.dot(vec1, vec2) / (np.linalg.norm(vec1) * np.linalg.norm(vec2))

```

Sir, Regarding the embedding questions, I had posted earlier. Now, I am writing the error I faced. I tried to use the OpenAI API, but I am getting the error as “The Maximum Quota has reached”. I tried using 5 new API Keys from OpenAI, from 5 different accounts. So, I had to use SentenceTransformers, Alibaba gte model. So, as the model has changed, I think so it is expecting answer as got from OpenAI Model, but as I used Alibaba gte model, I am getting different result. Can you please explain how to solve this issue? This will be helpful in my future codes. I could do chat requests but it is not giving output for Embedding requests, I tried it multiple times with multiple different keys.Thank You

This is my code for the 7th question of finding similarities. This code, I tried on my own, but it is showing Incorrect Matches. I think so it is due to the Aliababa GTE Model. Please correct me if I have gone wrong anywhere. Thank You

```

    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["OPTIONS", "POST"],  # Allows all methods (GET, POST, OPTIONS, etc.)
    allow_headers=["*"],  # Allows all headers
)

class similarity1(BaseModel):
    docs: list[str]
    query: str
@app.post("/similarity")
async def similarity(similarity1: similarity1):
    docs = similarity1.docs
    query = similarity1.query
    results_docs = model.encode(docs)
    results_query = model.encode(query)
    similarities = {}
    output = []
    for i in range(len(results_docs)):
        c = np.dot(results_docs[i], results_query) / (np.linalg.norm(results_docs[i])*np.linalg.norm(results_query))
        similarities[c] = docs[i]
    k = sorted(list(similarities.keys()))

There are few more tokens for the user prompt, I think if you add 7 or 8 then you would get correct answer.

Other way to do this question is send a request to anand sir’s aiproxy and in response you will get number of input tokens.

I inspected the JavaScript code of this website, I saw that the answer took my input and added 7 to it, why is it programmed this way? Even if I were to use the AI proxy that was given shouldn’t the number of tokens remain unaffected?

When you send request to openai through anand sir’s proxy it takes some tokens for user prompt.

When you use tokenizer from openai’s webpage then it doesn’t take care of that.

For question 7

![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/sakshi6479/48/110446_2.png) Sakshi6479:
> ```
> import openai
>
> ```

You won’t be able to send request through openai python module, here is one example how you would make a request

```
headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {OPENAI_API_KEY}'
}

json_data = {
    'model':'gpt-4o-mini',
    'messages':[
        {
            'role':'user',
            'content':'What is 2+2?'
        }
    ]
}
r = httpx.post('http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/chat/completions', headers = headers, json = json_data, timeout=10.0)

```

You would need to use professor Anand’s proxy or some other api key through which request can be made.  
Url’s for free api keys:

1. [AI Proxy](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/)
2. [OpenAI GPT-4o · GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models/azure-openai/gpt-4o/playground)

The way to use api’s is demonstrated in live sessions, also refer to this documentation [sanand0/aiproxy: Authorizing proxy for LLMs](https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy).

---

For question 8, you’ll need to use OpenAI’s function calling feature and identify which function needs to be called and arguments to be used, we discussed in last Friday’s session on functions like `order` and `cancel_order`.

Kind regards

Hello sir,

While working on this question, I’m encountering this problem. It looks like the request is being made successfully (and I verified it by a POST request via Postman ), however while submitting my URL at the assignment portal, I’m getting an error.

[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/6/b6feb2e4fd01c3630f5db6ee879eb4042b7cec09.png)image1550×207 22.2 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/6/b6feb2e4fd01c3630f5db6ee879eb4042b7cec09.png "image")  
[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/8/b81a8c44bd77972dadbeb69bb545ea7fe6c3203b.png)image1288×138 7.33 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/8/b81a8c44bd77972dadbeb69bb545ea7fe6c3203b.png "image")

I even tried deploying on a public URL using render. My guess is there is a formatting issue or it’s not sorting correctly based on the similarity score and not returning the top 3.

Would appreciate if I can get some clarity on the same

Thanks and Regards  
Shalini

Hello, I think the format of the response body should be like: { “matches” : [ “ABC”, “ABC”, “ABC”]}. I think it is because of your formatting issue.

[![Screenshot_20250204_032923](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/1/4/14b928ed4ee1d76113b90069812abf2b53ab4ef1_2_690x428.png)Screenshot\_20250204\_032923991×615 43.7 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/1/4/14b928ed4ee1d76113b90069812abf2b53ab4ef1.png "Screenshot_20250204_032923")

I had used (well gpt) the below two decorators to format:

```
class SearchRequest(BaseModel):
    docs: List[str]  # The list of documents to search through
    query: str       # The search query string

class SearchResponse(BaseModel):
    matches: List[str]  # The list of matched documents

.........

@app.post("/similarity", response_model=SearchResponse)


.........

return SearchResponse(matches=sorted_matches[:3])

```

It basically checks the Request and Response formatting. This worked for me. Hope it helps. And thanks btw for mentioning using POSTMAN, as I had never used it before, so it clicked in my mind after reading your post only that I can basically debug using POSTMAN. Thank you for that ![:grinning:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/grinning.png?v=12 ":grinning:")

```
{
  "matches": ["Contents of document 3", "Contents of document 1", "Contents of document 2"]
}

```

Check if your response is in this format.

Does the final submission get graded, or is the highest-scoring submission considered?

I’m facing an issue where my score dropped from 8 to 6.5 when I checked all the answers one last time before submitting. I suspect the drop is due to the 3rd and 7th questions.

[![Screenshot 2025-02-06 001446](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/0/b00269ee7b24a8f28c8ab53f4da556a11c8f3d27.png)Screenshot 2025-02-06 001446810×296 14.8 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/0/b00269ee7b24a8f28c8ab53f4da556a11c8f3d27.png "Screenshot 2025-02-06 001446")

The score drops because some questions may require you to either keep a server turned on or some dynamic changes may occur for some questions (The dynamic changes are intentional in some questions, in order to get students to learn by doing. So if you solved everything and the score is the maximum… just make that your last submission. The score you see is the score you will get for your last submission).

If you want check a question without submitting. Then just use the check button instead. But your last submission is whats scored.

Question 4:  
I am trying this :

```
{
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {"type": "text", "text": "Extract text from this image."},
        {
          "type": "image_url",
          "image_url": { "url": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANS.......=" }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

I am getting this error :  
Error: The image\_url.url must be the base64 data URL of the image  
I verified that my Base64 encoding for the image is correct ..

**Realizing the Value of Collaboration**

As I’ve been going through this course, one thing that’s really started to make sense to me is how important collaboration is. None of us can know everything — and that’s okay. We all have different strengths, and when we work together, especially on projects, those strengths really start to shine.

I’ve come to believe that collaboration isn’t just about dividing tasks, it’s about learning from each other, supporting one another, and finding smarter ways to solve problems as a team. It helps us get things done more effectively and on time, and honestly, it makes the whole learning process a lot more enjoyable.

This course is definitely helping me build that mindset, and I’m excited to keep growing through shared learning.  
if somebody feels the same then Reply , Thankyou

For Question 3, I was able to enable the answer box but the answer is always saying that either it is not valid json format or Error: Model must be gpt-4o-mini, not undefined.

I have tried multiple approaches but the same issue even after using help from Chat GPT. Could any one tell what is the correct answer?? Thanks!

Hello,  
I am also facing the same issue. In my last submission the score was 7.25. Right now it is showing 0. The problem is i had few questions remaining to solve and i dont know which ones now. All of them r showing empty in the solution box. Also i didnt write my answers someplace else, so i would have to solve all the questions again? And also if i just for example for testing submit solution of 1 question now then my score would get reduced from 7.25 to the marks of that 1 question i submitted right?

The knowledge required by students to do TDS has been revised during recent terms. ( Mentioned that as per industrial standards/ needs).

Additional programming skills are required(in addition to Python) to follow the TDS Course. That means indirectly, one should complete many courses diploma in programming before doing TDS.

In such a case, how to drop the course Tools In Data Science(already registered) and get it replaced with another course to save time and without incurring financial losses(as dropping a course refunds only a certain percentage of fees amount paid for the course), and do it again later in terms. It’s completely IIT Madras’s fault since it was mentioned in the academics site that no prerequisites were required for the course while the reality turned out to be far from promises. I want to either get the course structure for the TDS revised or get it replaced with some another course; incase of some course fee difference, I will pay the difference amount.

I feel that Week 1 is packed with tutorials from diverse areas. While I understand the necessity of these tutorials, they lack immediate exercises, which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained. Attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses.

Additionally, while solving GAs helps reinforce learning, they don’t seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials.

I would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there’s a better way to balance this.

PS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs or mini exercises after each module. Alternatively, we could increase questions in GAs to cover more concepts, though the first approach might be more effective. Another improvement could be to reduce the diversity of content in a single week to make it more manageable.

# Topic No: 164277 - Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]
**Topic Slug**: project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025
**Created At**: January 19, 2025 08:17:46

## Post by Anand S - January 19, 2025 08:17:46
**Post ID**: 581882

Please post any questions related to [Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/project-1).

Deadline: Sunday, February 16, 2025 6:29 PM

**Update on 27 Jan 2025**:

A *sample* evaluation script for Project 1 tasks A1-A10 is available at [tools-in-data-science-public/project-1 at tds-2025-01-project-1-wip · sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public · GitHub](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tree/tds-2025-01-project-1-wip/project-1)

You can use this to validate your code for Project 1.

Please note:

1. This is a sample. It **WILL** change.
2. Don’t rely on the dataset being the same. It **WILL** change.
3. LLMs give different results each time they are called. Make sure:
   * Your code gives correct results *reliably* (i.e. try a few times)
   * Change the task in the evaluation script slightly to test variations
4. Your [AI Proxy usage](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/) resets on 1 Feb. You have a limited budget. Utilize what you can this month.
5. For those who [submit their code](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOaljgV-INdbKrPotV9OMUKV01QVaFEfcnr5dAxBZqM4x37g/viewform?usp=dialog) by Friday 31 Jan, I will run a sample evaluation and share the results.

Hi Guddu ,

I didn’t make any changes to file and it worked for me. Can you mention what is need of making changes ?

command that I used :  
`uv run datagen.py 22f3002542@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --root ./data`

here --root option defines the folder where you want to store generated data. by default it would try to create a folder in root directory of operating system.

Kind regards  
Jivraj

Hi Aishik,

Pls add context to your query, without that we won’t be able to understand, where exactly you are facing problem.

Possible reasons for this issue:

1. Not using anand sir’s proxy url for sending requests.
2. Token not being correct.

While implementing task A5, I am confused about what recent actually means in the phrase “recent log file”, mentioned under task A5, in the problem statement. This confusion arises because there are no dates corresponding to the log files. Should I consider log-0 as the most recent one? or the log-<largest\_number> file? Please clarify.

The bash commands are usually run in a linux machine, but you can easily run those commands in VSCode without installing any virtual machines. Download the WSL extension in VSCode and you will get a WSL terminal to work with.

For more information watch this video <https://youtu.be/q74CP4fB7cY?si=M_zw8WzpmMCyVQat> or watch TDS Live Sessions.

Project 1 deliverables are all that matter. How you accomplish them is not very relevant. The keys to a successful Project 1 are:  
Deliverables,  
and *an example* of the Evaluation has been provided.  
If your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is considered.  
[![Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/4/8/488e23f9ea65d35c5ba806fab09f4b5934ed2ed4_2_500x500.png)Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am1764×1764 374 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/4/8/488e23f9ea65d35c5ba806fab09f4b5934ed2ed4.png "Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am")

Please read the documentation carefully from top to bottom.

So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test.

Kind regards

Extracting details from credit cards is sensitive, try using strong prompts or take code from LLM and execute it in script.

Regarding Wednenday 9-10 pm live session, maybe the instructors could also discuss how to use docker as a virtual environment using maybe ollama(local llm as now there is deepseek opensource, i doubt we would need to use openai for testing, just for production(test submission) would be enough) and also some agent(langchain, autogen, crewai) just a quick how-to on setting up and problems while setting up if possible

More resources on docker. Using docker as a virtual environment. Editing and executing code in Dockerfiles (like when you change code in src a web framework automatically reloads page(hot reload)), something along the lines of this .

> Regarding Wednenday 9-10 pm live session, maybe the instructors could also discuss how to use docker as a virtual environmen

In Tuesday’s(21 January) session we had discussed docker towards ending of session.  
What was discussed in that live session regarding docker:

1. Search for existing containers on repositories such as dockerhub.
2. Pull an existing docker image.
3. Run that image inside a container.
4. Enter to that container and modify something(such as installing python inside a ubuntu container, for customization or create some file)
5. Once done you can commit it.
6. And push customized container’s image to docker hub.

Regarding local models running for project1, it’s a good idea, we will see if it’s possible to discuss in session.

We had a session on 28th Jan introducing all the important aspects of Project.

If you do not do everything exactly as mentioned **especially the pre - requisites** mentioned in the Evaluation section you will get 0 in the project and *there will be no appeal* for failing to meet the pre - requisites of the evaluation criteria.

In order for us to evaluate the project you have to provide the deliverables mentioned above.

Kind regards

i updated the libffi package using sudo but while breaking something else can someone pls help me? [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)

history of commands in new codespace

```
    1  crewai --version
    2  pip install crewai crewai-tools
    3  python3 -c "import sqlite3; print(sqlite3.sqlite_version)"

    7  crewai create crew <project_name>
    8  crewai create crew b2b
    9  history

```

  
  

UPDATE: IT’s WORKING if you do this in order

```
    1  python3 -c "import sqlite3; print(sqlite3.sqlite_version)"
    2  export PATH=/opt/conda/bin:$PATH
    3  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/conda/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    6  conda install -c conda-forge typing_extensions
    7  exec bash
    8  crewai create crew "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent"

```

Something about different environment conda and python can the instructors please help me understand it(resources ), so i can trouble shoot this later with better accuracy come precision

Hi [@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382),

Yes datagen.py must be present in same directory from where you are executing evaluate.py.

Oh, You trying to use crewai locally for Project1

Hi [@JoelJeffrey](/u/joeljeffrey) ,

Filepath is unique for every file, which needs to be inserted to json file.

Ok. So just to confirm, since there are files with the same name, the json file should map the filepath and not the filename to the title right?

Hi Guddu,

We are planning several project sessions in order to show the workflow of creating a successful project.

Although you are returning a 200 ok, the get request file must match the expectation. In other words after running the first task for example, has the new format.md been formatted correctly and matches the expected output.

In this case you would write out the the `expected` variable in the `evaluate.py` and see if `result` variable matches the `expected`. Then you can figure out what went wrong.

Kind regards

the model keeps wrong answer, it says uvicorn for uv and has no info on how to run uv even after explicitly giving instructions(basically an older model) , basic “ls” command is also wrong, among other things. You can check your logs with respect to my api key.  
Do you think we could access a better model?

Maybe Download Deepseek 70b or even 671b and create an api while y’all run the model locally, in the long it would be cheaper for the course?  
because the model doesn’t know basic commands after telling how to do it.  
So if the model gives us wrong commands 2/3 times then how would we even solve the question.  
I spent a week on this just saying

Hello, I recently started working on the project. I understood how to do all the phase A tasks on a high level but I’m struggling to start the implementation of the first task in phase A. I’m confused mainly about how the /data directory is supposed to be created, I don’t know how to generate the data and a little confused about the output formats. I would appreciate if I could get in contact with anyone who could guide me in the right direction.

Hello everyone, [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
I had a few queries regarding the project;

1. I am preloading my docker image with uv and generating the /data files when the container is ran. For task A1, I am automating my server to remove the /data directory that’s already present and run datagen.py again. Is this fine?
2. For /read endpoint, is there a standard for parameters like “path=/data/format.md” or the parameter could be a plain english sentence like “path=show the data in format.md”?
3. Are we concerned about what’s shown on the console if I run a /run command as long as it gets the job done?
4. For tasks A1-10, are the file paths provided in the project doc standard or even they’re flexible? Ex. “Count the number of Wednesdays in file /data/format.md, and write just the number to /data/out.txt”

For Project-1 to complete, it requires:  
"You MUST complete ALL these 3 steps to get a score. Failure to do so will result in getting 0 in the project. If you do not do ALL these 3 steps before the deadline, there will be no appeal available.  
• Fill the form that is on the Project Page  
But I did not get the form; where is it? While I checked inside the project pages also.

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir, I see that the project 1 timeline was changed from February 7 - 17, 2025 to January 17 - February 15 which undoubtedly is a good increase in duration. However, I have my GATE DA exam on Feb 15 and the exam center is unexpectedly far. So, I request you to consider pushing the deadline to at least Feb 16. If not, I’ll still do my best.

[@21f3002390](/u/21f3002390) - AI Proxy is working and you *did* get the result. You can ignore any `costError`. It won’t happen in the future anyway.

**What’s happening?** I was trying to generate a unique hash for each request, as a precursor to caching requests. But I made a mistake in the code. Specifically, `crypto.createHash` is not supported in CloudFlare. [I fixed that](https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy/commit/5943b6d355deffff88ac07d17aa0c6969cacc3d5) by removing this. I’ll introduce caching later if required.

A query regarding the task description in the query given to LLM for phase A.

For task A3, we have been asked to count wednesdays and the python file corresponding to A3 does count for wednesday alone. However the example says the LLM might be asked to count Sundays or other days. Should we be modifying task A3 code? Or was that just an example and only Wednesdays would need to be counted?

Tasks in Phase A are defined but that does not mean it has to do one precise thing. If that was the case then there is no use for an LLM.

Your application should be able to take parse the input and be able to run commands that do similar things in parameterised fashion. It could be Wednesdays or Sundays or it might be in Arabic days or anything. So coding to precisely do something very specific is not the goal.

The program has to be intelligent to do a certain type or class of tasks.

We had a session introducing project. Week 3 session 1. But we will have a more hands on session on Tuesday.

Kind regards

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Will there be evaluation script for tasks in group B also?

Some questions about ‘B’ group tasks:

Q1: For the following tasks (B5, B7, B9, and B10) tasks, how will input files be provided? Will it be URL or will `datagen.py` also generate files for these?

Q2: For the above tasks as well as for B6 ( Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website), how should output be returned?

Q3: In task B8, for transcribing audio file, which Python package is recommended or do we need to use OpenAI API?

B5. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database  
B7. Compress or resize an image  
B8. Transcribe audio from an MP3 file  
B9. Convert Markdown to HTML  
B10. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data

its expecting to match every single detail in that even " and ’ .  
in that case changing evaluate.py will result in zero or less marks.  
llm will only handle -calling function based on query and parameter . What is it going to do about the logic of functions.

If i still focus on passing evaluate.py will it be any good sir [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)

Can you please demonstrate it by just doing One task or provide sample example code of 1 similar task in the way you explained here. It will be very helpful right now it is very confusing.

We will be doing project session on ~~Tuesday 9 Feb~~ [correction] Tuesday 11th of Feb (thanks [@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382) [@23f2000237](/u/23f2000237)) . Project 1 uses the things you learnt in week 1-3. But mostly week 2 & 3.

We dont do it in the beginning, (but introduced it 2 weeks ago in a live session), to give students chance to practise the new learnings from week 2 & 3.

The plan has always been to demonstrate a few tasks and have you try doing the rest.

Kind regards

Hi Aindree,

No its a typo (and will be corrected soon). In the context of what was written it clearly means it was *updated* on 27th January. The update being that the evaluation.py file was provided so that you could test your code against it.

Thanks for bringing it to our attention.

Kind regards

Hi

This would be only for a selected few questions right because say for the credit card question, where the LLM is involved, to get the card number itself, we have to give a fine-tuned and strong query.

I have done the a1 to a10 task and tried querying through localhost and its working fine basically all these ten steps but dont know whether its enough or not. also steps in phase B i am confused that should we create separate endpoints for these tasks or should it be with same /run endpoint and query. then will the input be random by any user. what about the output . where should it be given. phase b needs more explanation.

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Facing some issues in running my project. Taking an example of the Phase A - A3 task.

I am able to read my files through the GET/read/data/dates.txt query.  
I am also able to use the count\_wednesdays function through the POST/run task/count\_wednesdays.

But when I am entering a query such as “count\_wednesdays in data/dates.txt” I am unable to get a response.

Hi Andrew,

You have done a great job with the Phase A tasks. Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy.

I just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application.

**In other words getting 10/10 in `evaluate.py` does NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10 or 1/10 in the real evaluation.**

So do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of `evaluate.py`. It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general *idea* of the task.

That said, `evaluate.py` is a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application). Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty).

Hope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.)

**A word of caution:** *(i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation)* Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task (*possibly your first task*) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically.

Kind regards

Respected [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) and [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) ,

Is anyone actively monitoring the Discourse page? I have been raising this issue for the past few days, but there has been no response. Does this mean the TAs are not addressing students’ concerns?

I am encountering the following error while running my project with these LLM endpoints:

* **<https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions>**
* **<https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings>**

  This issue is blocking my progress, and I urgently need assistance to resolve it. Kindly provide guidance or suggest a solution at the earliest.

Looking forward to your response.

Thanks,  
Telvin Varghese

I am not able to understand how to do the Project 1. The date is also very near.

The problem I am facing is, When I did the Modules the page was different, but now in the Project 1 I am not getting any section to submit the project.

Please let me know where are the questions and how tot submit that.  
The deadline is near.

This where I need help, i tried doing with agentic framework but i failed with the model in llm proxy, which was highly suspect because, that model should have known what the uv framework but it seemed to me to be outdated. Hence executing code Interpreter tools failed as the model gave outdated code. I have raised this issue before

Hence i moved to function calling, using local llms as cost-effective solution and it was quite robust.

I just need to understand how the function should be general, maybe 2-3 tasks you could provide the general description along with all the ways one would query the agent llm(ie our project). This general function is what i need help with. Please kindly do the needful.

Hi Telvin

You have run out of tokens. Thats what the message is saying. You ran out 3 days ago. It was clearly mentioned that the limit is $1. You have exceeded $2.

[![Screenshot 2025-02-11 at 3.36.50 pm](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/1/b/1b74cf0c060e28cd3459173bce28d123a8d5da05_2_690x423.png)Screenshot 2025-02-11 at 3.36.50 pm2078×1276 305 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/1/b/1b74cf0c060e28cd3459173bce28d123a8d5da05.png "Screenshot 2025-02-11 at 3.36.50 pm")

In our current internal build of project 1, we have yet to exceed $0.50

As to whether it can be renewed is something we have still not yet decided, because the question you have raised equally would apply to everyone. Raising it for you means raising it for everyone. $1 for everyone equals raising it by $1600+ *(i.e Rs 1.39 Lakhs)* for us!

The budget question then involves more than one person. It also involves the BS Team Operations and not just the TDS team and therefore instead of responding with a response that is not useful, we typically try to solve the problem first and then respond.

In short we are working on it. But as we have mentioned repeatedly in our sessions, use APIs efficiently, thats part of the skill. As soon as we have a resolution we will inform everyone via an announcement and an email.

Kind regards

NEED HELP. CAN SOMEONE CONTACT OLLAMA AND ASK THEM TO CHECK THEIR CODE ITS HAS SOME SILLY MISTAKES IN CODE EXAMPLES. I DONT KNOW HOW TO DO IT.

[LINK TO PAGE WITH CODE EXAMPLE](https://ollama.com/blog/embedding-models)

[![Screenshot 2025-02-11 232608](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/2/7/27adf05313946c445fec614cd1fd17ba6c1f4cde.png)Screenshot 2025-02-11 232608919×714 22.4 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/2/7/27adf05313946c445fec614cd1fd17ba6c1f4cde.png "Screenshot 2025-02-11 232608")  
  
  
  
correct code in step 2 collection query step

```
response = ollama.embed(
  model="nomic-embed-text:latest",
  input=task
)
results = collection.query(
  query_embeddings=response["embeddings"], #here embeddings and also not list of list as response embeddings already gives correct format
  n_results=1
)

In the Task B5, where we have to run an SQL query on a sqlite or duckdb database, should I create a database on my own and then take the query to be ran on it as an argument? Or should I take the query as an argument and run it on the ticker\_sales.db in ./data folder? Please guide

*For task A2*:

* **A2**. Format the contents of `/data/format.md` using `prettier@3.4.2`, updating the file in-place

I am getting the following error:  
`🔴 A2 failed: Command '['npx', 'prettier@3.4.2', '--stdin-filepath', '/data/format.md']' returned non-zero exit status 1.`

However, running a **POST request** to <https://localhost:8000/run?task=Format+/data/format.md+with+prettier+3.4.2> gives successful output.

`{"success":true,"message":"Formatted and verified successfully!"}%`

Here is my code snippet:

```
def format_file(filepath):
    while True:  # Loop until formatting and verification pass
        try:
            result = subprocess.run(
                ["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--write", filepath],
                check=False,  # Don't raise exception automatically
                capture_output=True,
                text=True
            )

            if result.returncode != 0:
                return {"success": False, "message": f"Prettier write failed: {result.stderr}"}

            if verify_prettier_formatting(filepath):
                return {"success": True, "message": "Formatted and verified successfully!"}
            else:
                logging.info("Verification failed. Retrying formatting...") #Log the retry
                # If verification fails, the loop continues and prettier --write is executed again.

        except Exception as e:
            return {"success": False, "message": str(e)}

def verify_prettier_formatting(filepath):
    try:
        subprocess.run(["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--check", filepath], check=True, capture_output=True, text=True) #Capture output
        return True  # File is formatted correctly
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        logging.error(f"Prettier check failed: {e.stderr}") # Log the error from prettier check
        return False  # File is not formatted correctly

```

What am I missing here?

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj),

I followed what you taught in Feb 11 session and tried implementing task A1. My understanding is once i run the subprocess, datagen.py file should be run and /data folder should be created in the project folder. But it is not happening to me. I am getting the following error

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/var/folders/rj/z_3b8hl51558519w90k5hp600000gn/T/datagen4COEF3.py", line 284, in <module>
    os.makedirs(config["root"], exist_ok=True)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "<frozen os>", line 227, in makedirs
OSError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system: '/data'

```

If i can’t automate this process, i don’t see the point writing code for other tasks. Can anyone help me solving this error?

If I am not wrong, both the expected and actual result contain the same entries. It is just that the ordering is different. The expected result also doesnt follow any particular format (so does the actual result).

Kindly advise on this [@carlton](/u/carlton)

**EDIT** : Resolved on a later evaluation

For the task - \* **B10**. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data

Do we have to handle prompts for converting CSV to JSON or for writing an endpoint for doing so?

Dear Instructors ([@carlton](/u/carlton), [@iamprasna](/u/iamprasna)):

Confirming, just to be needfully pedantic:

It will **solely** be the responsibility of the Project Evaluator (human or machine) to parse the correct `AIPROXY_TOKEN` generated against my IITM email ID (presumably, per some database which holds all such generated `AIPROXY_TOKEN`s of the students who have generated one); and the correct `$IMAGE_NAME` (to-be-submitted by myself in the Project Submission Google Form) in `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`, correct?

Asking this seemingly obvious question, as (apparently) the actual `AIPROXY_TOKEN` is not to be included anywhere in the code, or the repository, or the dockerfile.

sir will the tasks of Phase A and Phase B change? like currently do we need to make llm write the code for all tasks dynamically or can we write a pre defined python code to execute tasks after the llm parses the task and runs python code

[@23f2001978](/u/23f2001978)

That error is usually if you are using the wrong endpoint (ie. using open ai libraries instead of sending requests to aiproxy).

Without seeing the request its hard to tell you what the cause of the error is.

Kind regards

could you please help me out on how to start with TDS Project-1, as I am stuck at the moment and don’t know where to start from. This project is very much unfamiliar for me and I need some guidance on how to start with it. It would be really great if you could provide some help through resources/materials/videos and help me complete the project. Thanks in advance!

My final docker image size is coming 1.25 gb, I am using the ubuntu base image as I thought it would be appropriate given the tasks. Is it ok with that size?

PS - Also I would be running out of token if I need to test again with some other base image now.

You do not need the whole of ubuntu!

Just python and uv

More like 128mb image.

Please watch Tues week 5 session 1

I could pull it down to 610 mb, using python:3.9-slim now, but there are some essential libraries that is needed which is taking up the space…will it be ok? I mean installing on the go with uv might lead to timeout during evaluation…

Sir in main.py file I’m defining task with different variables . But in evaluate.py tasks are defined by different variables to test and when I’m testing it using python evaluate.py it returns unsuccessful . I’m testing all my tasks of main.py with Postman it returns successful.  
My query is that how the tasks get evaluated and do i need to change my variables in main.py ? And what are the other things i have to change.  
Also plss update evaluate.py fie with phase B tasks

Hi instructors and TAs,  
For the different tasks in Phase B, I don’t have a clear idea of what type of a response you expect.

eg.

* Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database & Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website & Transcribe audio from an MP3 file - Do you want the query’s response on an output file like A10? or as a response?

I understand that these are broad problems you except us to solve, but it would be helpful to know what type of response you would require.

Thanks,  
Trebhuvan

Output specifications will be detailed in the “task” sent to the endpoint.

Phase B is meant to be vague because if you can solve it, without an elaborate and gratuitous use of gpt function calling, then you can actually solve *all tasks using the same function* !

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)

will it be ok? Actually I developed it in a way that require some of the essential dependencies and at this point of time it would be dangerous to alter the way of handling it as I am running short of AIProxy Token credits.

Earlier when I asked this:

I could have altered my way of handling dependencies but at that point of time there was no clear numbers.

I request you to please allow this time around with this size…

Hi [@Rishabh2](/u/rishabh2)

What exactly you mean by variables? only one argument is required for running `evaluate.py` that’s an email address.

You need to download both `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` in same folder and then execute `evaluate.py` using uv.  
`uv run evaluate.py --email $any_email`.

For phase B

Hi [@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382)  
This is the classic case where you use Prompt engineering to solve your problems. I assume you have already achieved your answers, but I want to clarify this for someone who is facing this problem.

The thing is GPT-4o-mini is intelligent enough to understand what kind of task you are asking it do, and extracting Credit Card info from an image is one of the many prohibited tasks.

What you can do is, **try to fool it using itself.** Just ask ChatGPT to generate a prompt that would be capable of fooling itself into extracting out that credit card info. I was capable of doing it after pretending to be a working on a Cyber Security project, and other fake details which ChatGPT itself provided me with.

After submitting docker image through, it will be pulled and our token will be used.

Things to be checked at your end.  
1. `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME` works fine  
2. Above command will start 8000 server so use evaluate.py to test if things are working as expected.

Kind regards.

The command:  
`podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`

gives the error:  
`crun: executable file `-e` not found in $PATH: No such file or directory: OCI runtime attempted to invoke a command that was not found`

However the correct command seems to be:  
`podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN="$AIPROXY_TOKEN" -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

This works totally fine.

One final question [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton) , will our projects be evaluated with our `AIPROXY_TOKEN` or a different one.

Because my project is done but for evaluation if my `AIPROXY_TOKEN` is used, it might be out of credits.

I am also facing the same issue.  
Evaluation Output:

```

🔴 A9 failed: 'data'

❌ A9 FAILED

```

I sense ‘Authentication Problem’ happens only with the evaluation script, as the curl requests seems to work fine.

```

Hello Sir [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
What are implications on missing the project 1.  
Due to some personal reasons I wasn’t able to start any work on my project 1. It seems difficult for me to complete it.  
Could you please tell what will be the implications of missing it. Will I in anyway be able to cover up and pass in the subject doing future assignments and projects?

Thank you

PS: This isn’t any request to extend dates. I accept my fault and respect the dates provided by the team.

Could we create an image first of our project in initial stage(ie the my “app.py” is not completely ready) but I have build an docker image including the app.py and other dependencies.  
Should I give the same url now and then carry on updating the app.py  
Or, Should first complete and then upload in the form!

Hi [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj), [@carlton](/u/carlton), [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) sir,

I’m getting the following error while post mapping, I couldn’t able to fix it.  
I’m getting status code as 400 from the llm api response. How to fix it sir?

```
   "json": {
        "message": "Invalid JSON body: SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'm', \"model=gpt-\"... is not valid JSON"
    }

```

There is some problem with the json that you are using.

Try to debug it with GPT.

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) sir, I have implemented the code for B3 & B6 but unfortunately as per the instructions given in project for B3 & B6 —

* **B6**. Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website
* **B3**. Fetch data from an API and save it

They are almost similar and it’s getting confusing in both cases, it’s given output based on B3 and not reading the input for B6, so could you please help me out with this?

Is anyone else facing this or a similar issue?

Two solutions

1. give proper permissions.
2. use docker containers this is what we will test on.

I would prefer 2nd approach

For B tasks use LLM to write code on the fly and execute it, use better prompts. In evaluation script detailed task will be provided with what data needs to be scraped, endpoints, parameters, etc.

Hi,  
If you read these questions carefully then they are not similar, one is asking you to extract data from a webpage, meaning you have to do something related to the HTML code. And the other is simply sending a request to a given endpoint.

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) ,  
In task A6  
**Find all Markdown (`.md` ) files in `/data/docs/` . For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with `#`  ). Create an index file `/data/docs/index.json` that maps each filename (without the `/data/docs/` prefix) to its title (e.g. `{"README.md": "Home", "path/to/large-language-models.md": "Large Language Models", ...}` ).**

Here expected output JSON “key” is file name or file path without prefix /data/docs/ as prompt is bit confusing . when “path/to/large-language-models.md” is given in example is actually referring to file path or filename itself is “path/to/large-language-models.md”.

This can easily be checked by runing the evaluate.py file.  
Anyways, a file present in data/docs/folder\_a/folder\_b/md\_file should be folder\_a/folder\_b/md\_file as key.

For as task description like this

* Write the # of Thursdays in `/data/extracts.txt` into `/data/extracts-count.txt`

I have given the prompt in such detail to the LLM but it is still not able to understand the task because of the “#” symbol. The task is getting truncated even before it reaches to the LLM.  
Can anyone help me on this because I have tried so many things to fix this but nothing seems to help.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
sir i have tried to solve the A1. when I want to check the solution we are asked for the datagen module as the evaluate.py have  
’

```
''from datagen import (
    get_markdown,
    get_dates,
    get_contacts,
    get_logs,
    get_docs,
    get_email,
    get_credit_card,
    get_comments,
    get_tickets,
)
'''

```

so do we need to download the datagen.py in the local system first…

Or it should be the part of the automation only…

Yes I know that but LLM does not know that # indicates number. And no prompt is fixing this issue because the task has to be passed as query parameter and by the time LLM reads the task, it is already half gone due to #.

If you are using the function calling approach, you could just parse the ‘#’ and change it to ‘number’ and then send the prompt to the llm for that particular task.

Or another approach is tell the llm,

If you ever see the phrase ‘count the # of’ in a task, please interpret it as ‘count the number of’. For example  
Count the # of Fridays means  
Count the number of Fridays

Please read the deliverables and evalute section.

datagen.py and evaluate.py were for only for your testing purposes so that you have an idea of the workflow and how the evaluation works. They are NOT part of your project submission.

Only DO what the project page tells you in the deliverables and evalute sections.

Kind regards

Hey [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) , I actually submitted the project already in the morning,  
I included all the deliverables and things mentioned in the evaluation section.

But since I was actively testing with the - `datagen.py` and `evaluate.py`, I forgot to remove them before submission.

However these files do not play a role in my project execution in any way, they just sit idle. Will there be any issue?

These files are inside a separate folder - `evaluation` in my project root directory. Since I already submitted please do consider.

Thanks & Regards

This indicates your task execution returns “HTTP/1.1 200 OK” but the execution doesn’t creates the required file in the given location that the evaluation script is requesting.

i too got the same error you can change the the tools part in your payload to

```
"tools": [{"type": "function", "function": schema} for schema in function_schema]

i think you have to run the following command

```
uv run datagen.py <your_email> --root ./data

```

try to include --root ./data in your code

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Hello,  
just a silly question, if my code runs well in docker environment with `/data` in root directory, will it be fine ?  
or should i keep the relative `./data` directory like in the lecture ?  
Thanks

The reason in the lecture they were using ./data was because they were debugging in their local machine not in the docker.

For the docker image (the official submission) you must use /data.  
It is a clear requirement mentioned in the project page.

Thats why it works fine when you use it in the docker image.

Kind regards

it usually happens in some GNU/Linux OS. since you are using some distribution based on Debian namely Ubuntu or whatever try doing sudo apt install python-packagename (replace package name with fastapi for fastapi)  
then it works. It usually happens due to manual intervention with pip3 the user might break some system dependencies which require some python3 package. No need to worry about it.  
Another Fix: try using a virtual environment which is highly suggested since there is no chance for you to interfere with the system packages.  
create a venv using python3 -m venv name\_of\_venv  
add this line to your .bashrc in ~ folder as source /path/to/your/venv/location  
and run source .bashrc. This time no error occurs as you do everything in your virtual environment you can install anything python3 package using pip3 install package name.  
It even happened for me

Everytime I run datagen.py for the A1 task, the data file gets downloaded in the C drive instead of the current project folder. I even tried to set the current project folder as the root directory but it still downloads the files in C drive and I cant seem to find a workaround this. Can someone please help with this issue. Thanks!

Can you please make the changes in the datagen.py file

config = {“root”: “/data”}

This is where I have been facing the issue.

The only solution I can think of is moving the /data folder from the root to the project directory. which I am not sure is a good way to solve this issue.

you have to give the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` to the evaluate.py by either  
bash - `export AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token"`  
or  
powershell - `$env:AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token"`  
the evaluate.py file takes the token to send request to embedding end point for processing.  
so you have to set `AIPROXY_TOKEN` in both terminals  
i.e. app.py and evaluate.py teminals

Respected Sir,  
I sincerely request you to kindly consider granting a one-day extension for Project 1. Many key clarifications were provided in today’s session, and we need just one additional day to effectively implement them. This extension would be immensely helpful in ensuring a more refined submission.

hey I have a few doubts, if something was said about this please say so.

1. in Phase be tasks do we have to store the output in files or just return it in the response
2. When I call my some of my endpoints using post man or CURL they work but if I run the evaluate.py it throws an error, this I think is a bug in the eval.py file.

any idea about these ?

Blunder in your `main.py`.  
You are using API\_KEY = os.getenv(“AI\_PROXY\_TOKEN”) but it should be AIPROXY\_TOKEN.

Btw what you using for phase B?

What we expect in project.

1. server running inside docker container at 8000.
2. And all files will be accessed from data folder in root directory.

Apart from these two you can have anything extra.

This might be problem with network settings(unstable internet, firewall, VPN interference)

try to debug it with help of chatgpt.

You can also use codespaces for trying another network.

No don’t do that, just follow the procedure.  
Two problems with keeping token in file.

1. It will become public after you push to github.
2. While running evaluation script after submission your token might run out of credits.

On my system evaulate.py is throwing an error on A2 trying to execute npx on format.md before the llm is even invoked. However running the command directly on the command line works.

evaluate.py:  
![:red_circle:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/red_circle.png?v=12 ":red_circle:") A2 failed: Command ‘[‘npx’, ‘prettier@3.4.2’, ‘–stdin-filepath’, ‘data/format.md’]’ returned non-zero exit status 2.

![:x:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/x.png?v=12 ":x:") A2 FAILED

bash:  
npx prettier@3.4.2 --stdin-filepath data/format.md

bash works as expected. Can someone help?

Hi ,

I am trying to build using both docker and podman but it failed on both. I have watched many videos trying to resolve this adn also chatgpt in order to resolve the issue but it seems to persist. I even uninstalled and reinstalled both podman and doceker multiple times but no help.

When i run command docker build -t \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ .

the error that comes is :

## Dockerfile:2

## 1 | # Use a lightweight Python image 2 | >>> FROM python:3.12-slim 3 | 4 | # Set the working directory in the container

ERROR: failed to solve: python:3.12-slim: failed to resolve source metadata for [Docker Hub Container Image Library | App Containerization](http://docker.io/library/python:3.12-slim:) failed to copy: httpReadSeeker: failed open: failed to do request: Get “<https://docker-images-prod.6aa30f8b08e16409b46e0173d6de2f56.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/registry-v2/docker/registry/v2/blobs/sha256/6f/6f3c6367c5a38963f84310cbb24dfcfbddab1dad40cff18afb8fe89098891f08/data?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=f1baa2dd9b876aeb89efebbfc9e5d5f4%2F20250215%2Fauto%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250215T192245Z&X-Amz-Expires=1200&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=ed37cf0c346e2ed440f29638ec43ce66640bdc7d285e7be7bf25c308c46fd6b1>”: dialing [docker-images-prod.6aa30f8b08e16409b46e0173d6de2f56.r2.cloudflarestorage.com:443](http://docker-images-prod.6aa30f8b08e16409b46e0173d6de2f56.r2.cloudflarestorage.com:443) container via direct connection because static system has no HTTPS proxy: connecting to [docker-images-prod.6aa30f8b08e16409b46e0173d6de2f56.r2.cloudflarestorage.com:443](http://docker-images-prod.6aa30f8b08e16409b46e0173d6de2f56.r2.cloudflarestorage.com:443): dial tcp: lookup [docker-images-prod.6aa30f8b08e16409b46e0173d6de2f56.r2.cloudflarestorage.com](http://docker-images-prod.6aa30f8b08e16409b46e0173d6de2f56.r2.cloudflarestorage.com): no such host

Even tried getting python:3.12-slim separatly and trying again but that also didn’t work.  
I think there is some problem in getting python:3.12-slim as the build always stops at this.

on asking ChatGPT it shows that some DNS or network issue is there. I even tried all the remedy that was provided on creating custom network etc. but this was also of no use

Kindly help me finding solution to this and pls mention any other assistance I may require to get this running

Thank You.  
Regards,  
Aagman

[@carlton](/u/carlton) needed a confirmation on this task

`A8 * `/data/credit-card.png` contains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to `/data/credit-card.txt` - in this task i assume prompt can ask for credit card number or other details like cvv and name.

My question is, whether my system should allow prompt that CVV or or such info ? or should give it ?

1. Previously I asked for some more credits to test my project. I got an email stating I have been provided with a new token but I think I got that same token again, not a new one. I still cant send request to the AIPROXY. Please help.
2. Do I need to submit the docker image name with the tag or without the tag? I submitted it before without the tag. Now i see that I have tagged the image with as v1 but I cant submit the form due to pattern matching problems. Should i submit again after tagging it with :latest ?

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  
When I run my docker image using

`podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

Task A2 fails as the podman container is unable to find npx.

Running the same image using

`docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

works fine and Task A2 passes. I can’t understand why this is happening.

I also ran the image in both docker and podman in interactive mode as show in the below snippet from terminal.  
When run using docker, `which node` gives `/usr/bin/node` as output but when run using podman, nothing.

```
shiva@shiva:~/Desktop/tdsp1$ sudo podman run --rm -it docker.io/myusername/myreponame /bin/sh
# echo $PATH
/root/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

sir I am noticing a pattern, that when I am running the datagen first. And then using the evaluate.py, then I am getting the A2 right.  
But running the evaluation.py for the 2nd time cause the A2 to fail…  
Probabbly Because the file in the data folder gets upated should I worry for that…

There has been an outage in some parts of the country related to cloudflare servers. What helped some students (and us) is using a completely different network eg. instead of using your home wifi, use mobile internet, since they go through a different DNS and this sometimes works.

Will this be considered as failure in actual evaluation as well or will this be taken care in actual evaluation?

But the data gets downloaded to C drive instead of the project folder

am I making any error when setting the directories?

Please help, have been facing this issue since the beginning of this project, initially tried to move the files from C drive to project folder but that does not seem like a viable solution.

Use following as first parameter of `subprocess.run()` to create `data/` directory inside your project instead of C: drive

```
["uv", "run", script_url, user_email, "--root", "./data"]

```

Also, you don’t need to download to script, you can directly run it from the url.

The reason for error is `evaluate.py` is trying to import `datagen.py` which doesn’t exist in your system. I’ll suggest download both the files, keep them in same folder and run `evaluate.py` from your computer

### Generation-Based Automation Agent (No Hard Coding)

**Repository Link:** [GitHub - 23f2005593/tds](https://github.com/23f2005593/tds)

Currently, it can complete 7 out of 10 tasks. In reality, it can complete 9 out of 10 tasks, but the expected results are not flexible in evaluate.py file.

If we can extract credit card numbers, it will be able to complete 10 out of 10 tasks.

Please contribute to this repository. **We will win together.**

sir for this task- A6 Find all Markdown (`.md` ) files in `/data/docs/` . For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with `#`  ). Create an index file `/data/docs/index.json` that maps each filename (without the `/data/docs/` prefix) to its title (e.g. `{"README.md": "Home", "path/to/large-language-models.md": "Large Language Models", ...}` ) …I am getting correct result for all files but for the very first file budget.md it shows wrong.  
my result- { “budget.md”: “Success easy same main modern doctor.”,  
“build.md”: “Shoulder follow own never above.”,  
and in the data files there is different heading in budget.md.- # Series dog who make specific agree between.  
my question is this if it works for all the files then why not for this file budget.md [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

Check the file once, there is a possibility that it’s either fetching a comment or the second heading. Refactor your prompt to search only for the First Heading, specify it explixitly.

This is happening because evaluate.py is unable to fetch your API Key from the environment variables. Create a new variable and set it’s value to your API Key then try.

Hi everyone,

I’m running into an issue with the AI Proxy embeddings endpoint while executing the A9 task. Every time I send a POST request to:

bash

Copy

```
https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings

```

I receive a **401 Unauthorized** response. This, in turn, causes my code to fail with a `KeyError: 'data'` because the expected JSON response doesn’t include the `"data"` key.

### What I’ve Tried

1. **Token Verification:**

* I’m using the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` obtained by logging in at [aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/) with my IITM email.
* The token is passed in the header as follows:

python

Copy

```
"Authorization": f"Bearer {AIPROXY_TOKEN}"

```

* I added debug prints to confirm that the token is being used correctly (printing the first few characters).

2. **API Request Details:**

* The request includes the correct `Content-Type: application/json` header.
* The payload is set as:

json

Copy

```
{"model": "text-embedding-3-small", "input": ["Test"]}

```

* Despite this, the response status is consistently 401 Unauthorized.

3. **Debug Output:**  
   Here’s a snippet of the debug output:

bash

Copy

```
HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized"
🔴 A9 failed: 'data'

```

This confirms that the issue is with the authentication rather than our processing logic.

### What I Suspect

* The token may be invalid, expired, or misconfigured.
* There could be changes in the token permissions or endpoint requirements that I’m not aware of.
* Alternatively, there might be an issue on the server side with token validation.

### Request for Help

Has anyone else encountered this issue recently? Could someone verify if there are any changes to the authentication requirements for the embeddings endpoint? Any insights or updated instructions on how to ensure the token is valid and has the proper permissions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance for your assistance!

B5. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database  
Should I ask for the SQL data base. Or the agent should be smart enough to find the required database…  
Moreover in the data folder there is only one database is it should be robust to handle multiple databases…

I had a question on evaluation by the course team. To test that my application would run everywhere, I first deleted all images from my local machine using `podman rmi -a` and then ran `podman run --rm -p 8000:8000 -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN $IMAGE_NAME` with the appropriate variables set. This is as per the instructions provided [here](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tree/tds-2025-01-project-1-wip/project-1). But this gave me the following error:

```
Error: short-name "freshbash/dataworks-agent" did not resolve to an alias and no unqualified-search registries are defined in "/etc/containers/registries.conf

```

The above is the format in which we have to provide the image name in the Google form. So, I was confused whether this would succeed during actual evaluation.

The only way its working right now is when I specify the image name to be `docker.io/freshbash/dataworks-agent`

I’m not yet very good with how containers work so some insights would be very helpful. Thanks!

Hey I just got a mail saying that my github repo has no Dockerfile present. and im confused .

It doesnt mention anywhere that the dockerfile must be present in the root directory as a requirement/prerequisite of the project.

In my case its present inside the app directory. Could the team help clarify on this issue.

I got a mail saying my Dockerfile is missing. However I have a dockerfile already in my github repository. Is it an issue with the spelling of dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‘dockerfile’. It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by iitm.

Shall I just change the name of the file from ‘dockerfile’ to ‘Dockerfile’ in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile?

Dear [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) , [@carlton](/u/carlton) , [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) , and [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

Thank you all for this wonderful project. Coming from a non-coding background, I have learned a lot new things throughout this project building process.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir, yesterday’s session provided valuable insights into Method 1 (prompt engineering) for dynamically handling tasks. I was able to develop an application using this approach; however, due to submission time constraints, I could not verify all tasks (my bad). While I tested some tasks and found the results to be highly accurate, I was unable to validate everything thoroughly.  
Therefore, I submitted the function-calling approach (Method 2) instead.

I sincerely appreciate everyone’s guidance and support.

How long does it take to make a docker image, I’ve been doing it for the past 25 minutes and it’s still not completed.

1. Your LLM app should be designed like it can give desire result based on task desc at run endpoint, and that result should be accessible at read endpoint.
2. Evaluation file just for reference to check how things works and it works for phase A tasks only. Also ensure datagen.py file and evaluation.py file are latest. There is one issue in evaluation.py file for task A1, link of datagen.py file not correct, rectify that link. Even it corrected in GitHub repo file but when I download that raw file in local system it takes back previous link.

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
Dear Sir,

I am writing to you in a state of distress and humility. An unfortunate mistake on my part has led to the upload of an incorrect Docker image link. When I checked the authenticity of the link, it showed an error, even though the GitHub repository link is functioning perfectly.

I have poured my heart and soul into this project, dedicating countless hours and sleepless nights to ensure its success. The project has successfully passed both Test A and Test B, and I was thrilled to see my hard work paying off. However, this single error has left me devastated.

I am pleading with you, with all my heart, to allow me to correct this mistake by updating the Docker image link. Alternatively, I humbly request that my application be reviewed directly through GitHub. Please consider this an exception, as I have worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to create an application that is 890 lines long.

I beg for your understanding and leniency in this matter. This project means the world to me, and I am genuinely sobbing over this setback.

Thank you for considering my heartfelt request.

Sincerely,

Rishit Jain  
(24F2004595)

I don’t think the project is too difficult to implement—it’s essentially a simple HTTP API for an AI agent that reads a task, converts it into parameters, and passes those parameters to specific functions to complete the task. However, the instructions in the project question aren’t very clear. Before the session, I am unable to fully understand the question. It took me almost an entire day just to understand what we need to do.  
Sir Could you provide test cases or a sample answer for Phase B?

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand)  
[@carlton](/u/carlton) sorry to disturb you, project1 deadline is over.  
I made a mistake in my project. In my call llm function i set some payload instead of default for open ai api call like max token, temp. , n, stop etc.  
Due to this, some tasks may fail especially credit card image task will fail 100%, if possible can i just remove that payload from git hub repository . or you can check this call llm function present in my task\_handler.py file of my repository.  
I found this issue after deadline. If possible consider this request. I never engaged in a project or course like for this one. I love this project genuinely.

[@TheVishal](/u/thevishal)  
EDIT: Create a new docker image with the mistaken image name , so when they pull image from repo, that image with the wrong name also gets pulled.  
what to do

* push a new image with the mistaken name, so in your repo there will be two images  
    
  how will this help?
* since you are unsure, which image link you posted, you can be sure that even you had a mistake in link, a new image will exist with the wrong name after you push another image

@all  
use this to update your image even after submission, as now they only validate the images, they do not pull it so you can edit your project and add more functionality if they release the code solutiion

CHEERS

As soon as I realized my mistake, I hit the submit button but this was shown then,  
“The form TDS Jan 2025 - Project 1 Submission is no longer accepting responses.”

I apologize for this. I have been working on this project for weeks.  
This was my first TDS project. I would highly appreciated, if you could help me.

The project was a rollercoaster ride—especially with all the errors that kept popping up—but overall, the experience was incredibly enriching. The amount of knowledge I gained was truly valuable.

A huge thanks to [@Carlton](/u/carlton), [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini), and [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir for their guidance and support. Without the last week’s lectures, the project couldn’t have been completed.

This project is one of the best experiences I had in the entire degree program. I could say this without any hesitation that what I learnt in the past 10 days >> last 3 months.

I really appreciate the idea of open internet type of evaluations, wherein, you implement things without any constraints, learning for the sake of implementing.

Doing this project, I also found many new ideas wherein function calling can be used to solve new problems. I also learned many new things from enthusiastic peers like [@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382) and also got the chance to help a few.

I thank the entire TDS team - [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir, [@carlton](/u/carlton) , [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) for their support throughout this amazing experience.

It clearly says in your error message:

Invalid value: ‘json’

if you look at the “type” key in your response\_format variable at the top,

the value cannot be “json”

The error is telling you what the supported values are

‘json\_object’, ‘json\_schema’, and ‘text’

Since you are defining a schema the correct value should be ‘json\_schema’

So therefore you should change

```
"type": "json"

```

to

```
"type": "json_schema"

```

If you have trouble constructing Json schemas,  
either feed it to gpt and have it correct it (along with your error) or please go over Module 3, in particular

<https://tds.s-anand.net/#/llm-text-extraction>

There is a clear example you can use as a template. We use the same one as a template when we do it in the sessions. That way you will make less errors.

No human peer reviews. The peer will be an LLM that has been given the rubrics and fine tuned.

I know this is a late reply, but its not possible for us to consider changes to your project after the deadline for academic integrity purposes.

If we were to allow it, we would have to allow everyone to make changes to their project as well for it to be fair.

Alright, [@Carlton](/u/carlton). No problem at all, and thank you for your response.

I just wanted to bring a small limitation in my project’s LLM function to your attention, which I discovered after submission. It may impact one or two tasks. However, no concerns—this has been a great learning experience.

And if possible, just add one line in your Evaluation LLM prompt: *“Give loose marking for effort!”*—because, you know, creativity deserves some extra credit! ![:slightly_smiling_face:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=12 ":slightly_smiling_face:")

PS ( [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) ): My P1 submission had passed all the basic sanity checks on 15th February. No breaking modifications to the Github repo nor the DockerHub image have been made since then. There’s something bugged in your scripts. Kindly check.

Could you please confirm the correct deadline to avoid any confusion?

It is saying you did not attempt it because you did not answer the seek portal question.

You are not graded on the seek portal question. It only exists to make sure you saw the GA and attempted it. You are only graded on your submission of GA1 on the actual assignment page where your last saved submission is used for grading.

Kind regards

According to your previous replies, does it imply that only the answers submitted through the link provided will be considered for evaluation regardless of the seek portal selection for this time?

Correct! Only scores that were saved in your actual last submission on the ga page itself will be evaluated (the portal question is just to make sure you were aware of the GA and confirm that you attempted it).

Thats not the dashboard.

We have checked your submissions. Unfortunately your last submission was 0 (on the 19th of Jan). Only the last submission is considered for evaluation not the previous ones.

Hi Yogesh,

There is no discrepancy, your last submission *before* the deadline was on 22nd Jan 8:14 pm. You scored 7.25, exactly as mentioned in your recent saves.

The higher score was on the 27th of Jan *after* the deadline.

Respected Sir [@carlton](/u/carlton),

I realized there are still many topics to learn in order to complete the TDS Course ( With an A or S Grade) as I have missed some questions (Couldn’t do even after studying the videos ) .

Therefore wanted to learn and regardless of the scoring I still wish to complete GA1 but, I see that I can’t access the questions anymore …

Is there any way to give the answers in the portal and check. I just want to learn and test my knowledge

Thank You,

# Topic No: 165922 - Best Practices for Virtual Environments and Dependency Management in Python
**Topic Slug**: best-practices-for-virtual-environments-and-dependency-management-in-python
**Created At**: January 31, 2025 06:26:47

## Post by Shalini Saravanan - January 31, 2025 06:26:47
**Post ID**: 588140

Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.

Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical?

That said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I’d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently.

## Post by Carlton D'Silva - January 31, 2025 06:50:45
**Post ID**: 588153

Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:

1. **Isolation** – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.
2. **Reproducibility** – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.
3. **Portability** – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.

---

1. **Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name)**

• Good for quick experimentation and testing.

• Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.

2. **Using requirements.txt**

• Best for **reproducibility** and **collaboration** since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

• Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup.

**Specifying Versions in requirements.txt**

• If you **don’t specify a version**, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.

• If you **do specify a version (package==1.2.3)**, you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.

**Handling Version Conflicts**

• If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.

• Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:

• Using **greater than/less than constraints**: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).

• Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.

**Best Practices Summary**

* Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).
* Use a **requirements.txt** file for reproducibility.
* Pin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.
* Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.

Kind regards

**Post ID**: 588155

For some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it’s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions.

Whereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine.

> For project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement

> Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file?

Coming to your second question,

The first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone’s project it’s better to use requirements.txt.

> My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation

The creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed.

> Never try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that, `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` . This does the hard work of listing the dependencies for you

I have a doubt regarding the bonus mark. Suppose someone were to get 10/10 in the assignment, would their mark be recored as 11/10 or just 10?

Just a quick query on the Bonus mark.

Would this be added to the final grade? Say for example, Someone get a full score in the first 4 assignments. So the total comes up to 39.5/39.5, and would be converted to 0.15 or 15 marks. Would the bonus mark be additional to that 15 or would the score change to 40.5/39.5 and then get normalised to 15?

[@JoelJeffrey](/u/joeljeffrey) It will be added to the GA4 marks, not the final grade. So, it’s roughly worth 0.15% on the total - not a full 1% on the total.

Have a step with your email id as its name. (Instead of checkout repository)  
Also make sure you give read and write permission so it commits without any error

Hi Tushar,

If you looked at the PDF you might have realised that students have been grouped. The question gives you a range for the groups 43-66. Including both groups implies both group 43 and 66 are included in your calculation.

kind regards

  "2025-01-02": "Partly cloudy with a chance of rain",
  "2025-01-03": "Overcast skies",
  // ... additional days
}

```

And My Output after scraping (And as explained by professor in Video 2 BBC weather was)

{  
“2025-02-05”: “A clear sky and light winds”,  
“2025-02-06”: “A clear sky and light winds”,  
“2025-02-07”: “A clear sky and light winds”,  
“2025-02-08”: “A clear sky and light winds”,

What you meant by " Ensure the first item is schedule triggered confirmation"? You meant the latest one should be this right?

In the question no. 10, I have tried numerous time to get it right markdown content but it was incorrect all the time.

I have tried these steps:

```
import pymupdf4llm
md_text = pymupdf4llm.to_markdown("/content/q-pdf-to-markdown.pdf")

import pathlib
pathlib.Path("output.md").write_bytes(md_text.encode())

```

Then i run this in bash

```
prettier --write output.md

```

And what i got frankly telling was far from this, I did some manual touchups, and this what i have now. This is the best version i could come up with. Saw the preview, it does matches with the pdf.

#Can someone please advise me a better approach?

try manually inspecting the output of the api and compare it with your script output.  
Or else try refreshing the browser and check.

On popular demand, I’ve made Q10 of GA4 easier (converting from PDF to Markdown). The question remains the same, but the check is more liberal and the error messages are more helpful. Please give it a shot now.

(FYI, one person *did* solve it. A colleague, not someone from the IITM DS program.)

Hello Sir, i tried but unfortunately after extracting the contents and formatting the contents and submitting it, it’s showing various errors like Missing links, Missing tables…

But on checking the file i wasn’t able to find any single table in the contents in that case what could be done to fix these errors?

I am getting missing link error. I checked in the pdf file also, the blue color text seems a link but its not clickable.  
Any suggestion to move nearer to the actual solution.

I think the idea behind this font is to make it difficult for people to manually work on the markdown file from scratch. I guess they want us to use the tools (like PyMuPDF4LLM, markitdown) they provided as resources to convert pdf into a markdown and then may be we can do some manual intervention to make it to the result as the scraping tools are not 100% accurate.

Could be another reason too. TAs’ can feel free to pitch in.

1. There are only four texts which look like link texts in the pdf.  
   All four properly coded in link markdown syntax, in the preview, they appear as link texts same as in pdf.

Link text

Even after chaning all the 4 texts which appered in blue color in the pdf to link texts,  
below error is still observed.

Error: Missing links

Did anyone else face same issue ?

2. Also, no text in the pdf looks like a code block.  
   But, Missing Code error was seen and after changing one of the paragraph by using markdown code syntax that error is gone.

Appreciate any suggestions on the link error.

[@21F1005510](/u/21f1005510) Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names. For example, [The Recruit](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/) is [also known as Graymail in India](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/releaseinfo/?ref_=tt_dt_aka#akas). My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles.

**Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated?** Because this is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect. You often need to create workflows where you’re able to quickly correct such errors in automation.

This is the only thing which worked for me.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir, can I suggest to replace the snapshot of example output which expects the year to be an integer and the ratings as to be floats (instead of actual evaluation which expects them to be strings). Also, it would help to clarify that “Movie 1” should carry the numerical prefix as reported in IMDB. The current example on the portal is:

Sir, In Graded Assignment - 4 >> Q2, the year I extracted appears as “2024,” whereas the expected value on the portal is “2024–”. I have manually adjusted several values based on the expected format. This issue is specific to the year field.

I use different classes to extract values for various fields. Could there be any other element on the portal affecting this extraction?

In Q4, one of my classmates is encountering a “root property” error despite using the same extraction method as I do. Upon checking, I found that this issue occurs because the city’s time is displayed as the previous day compared to our time. The portal results seem to be based on the city’s actual time rather than IST.  
I would appreciate your guidance on these issues.

I guess for the year part, there are certain series having multiple seasons, for which hyphenated “years” are given.

For the particular instance - `“2024–”`, it appears another season/part is announced, thats why it is written that way.

Thanks [@21f2000709](/u/21f2000709) for this information. I figure out where i made mistake. During writing console code I added to remove non numeric values in year field which i guess removed that hyphen (“–”). I will rectify that.

GA 4 Q2

My JSON matches the titles of the movies as in the website, but in portal it is showing error and expecting something different from what is given in the website. How to handle this ?

contradiction :  
" 2. Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey" (in web page) & ( delivered by the JSON)  
" 2. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey" (expected in portal ) & ( raising error statement )

Thanks for your response.  
Many such titles have contradiction from what is expected and what is there in the website. This case the samples are 25 your approach is accepted to some extent, but on a larger sample space, need to work it right !

For this question, you may use the Google Colab file referenced in the assignment. This file will provide you with the date and description. Additionally, you can generate a weather location ID for the city specified in your assignment. Using this ID, you will obtain the weather URL, which you can then use to verify the date and description.

and in the question also it is mentioned that may be manually you need to correct. just give a try.

The result is dynamic with changes made in the API. So try re-executing your code today and it will automatically solve. Your code is right ! Just make a re-run and things will work out ![:slight_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/slight_smile.png?v=12 ":slight_smile:")

Titles (from the output json) should be replaced by the titles which shows in the error message “Expected”. It can only be done manually. There may be multiple titles need to be translated by this method.

I face the same error, also thinking of issueDate, the value seems to be constant in every loop inside forecasts array (is it because the data is issed on that particular date) that gives same issue date key across the json outcome. Anyways the new json with same issueDate also gives the same Root error

That is perhaps to ensure we don’t manually write the markdown for the pdf. Converting the pdf to markdown and getting the correct output is extremely hard, I tried doing that multiple times yet wasn’t able to get that right by the original method.

But since it is mentioned that the GAA is hackable and we are allowed to do so, for some of the questions, therefore you can try solving that by establishing a breakpoint in the sources and then write the code in the console to get the expected output.

Write the code referencing the provided collab file and make sure to use the API key  
The output actually changes once in a while so you might need to run the code a few times before getting in right

Just copy paste the expected value in place of actual value in json. Keep doing this eventually it would be the answer would be correct.

This is a format issue when the json is scrapped from the browser.

Request help on Q4 aboutBBC weather data, the instructions in the question tell us to use BBC broker API and get issueDate & enhancedWeatherdescription value pairs. However, it seems there are only 2 unique values of issueDate (not the expected 14 days)

Please clarify, sharing code and output below for reference.

Code:

```
import requests

url = "https://weather-broker-cdn.api.bbci.co.uk/en/forecast/aggregated/" + getlocid('Bogota')
response = requests.get(url)
json_data=response.json()
print(f"The number of days data is {len(json_data['forecasts'])}")

weather_data = {}

for i in range(len(json_data['forecasts'])): # Use range to create an iterable sequence of indices
  issue_date = json_data['forecasts'][i]['summary']['issueDate']
  weather_description = json_data['forecasts'][i]['summary']['report']['enhancedWeatherDescription']
  weather_data[issue_date]=weather_description
  print("Iteration No. " + str(i))
  print(issue_date)
  print(weather_description)
  
print("Final Weather Data json below")

I have got the same error as well, verified there are workflows run in my repo/actions/runs  
When I checked the reasons, it could be due to API limit exceeded in a hour, but tried even after some time but no workflows found.

Manual correction will not work. Try to extract - from the console. I did it like that it was not working then I extracted from console then it worked

Please ensure that your .yml file should have step name as your email Id. then Manually trigger the task (don’t wait till the scheduled time), ensure it was committed within 5 minutes and that commit should be top most item in all workflows. Then check it, it will work

When I resave the questions, the previously correct questions turn wrong which is extremely frustrating and time taking. I wish there is an option which saves the correct answer and does not require us to have multiple processes running in our pc even after getting the answer right previously.

you have to manually change for a few mismatch.

> [@21F1005510](/u/21f1005510) Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names. For example, [The Recruit](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/) is [also known as Graymail in India](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/releaseinfo/?ref_=tt_dt_aka#akas). My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles.

The API is returning 14 days of forecast data, as evidenced by the output However, the issueDate values are not unique for each day. Instead, they represent the time when the forecast was issued or updated.  
In your output, there are only two unique issueDate values:  
2025-02-08T04:00:00-05:00  
2025-02-08T16:01:58-05:00  
This means the forecast was updated twice on February 8, 2025, once at 04:00 AM and again at 4:01 PM (both in EST timezone) …To get a unique weather description for each day, you need to modify your approach by using the actual forecast day for each day instead.

I posted this error message but now the first issue got resolved but I am still keeping it in my post so that if anyone faces same issue, they can try if they can fix it similar to how it worked for me.

Please help with the second issue.

1. For Q8, the workflow is running on Github and commiting the scraped results to the json file (which is so amazing for me btw!). But I am getting this error for my public repo.  
   How it got resolved: I set up fixed time for cron schedule instead of every 5 min. Now it works.

> Error: No daily scheduled triggers found in workflows.

2. I had all correct results for Q1 to Q7 till yesterday but it keeps giving errors even when I reload same file for some questions. Do I need to keep addressing those errors or if once correct and saved, I can ignore those?

But I feel the question instructions should be adjusted accordingly - the question says to get every issueDate and enhancedweatherDescription key value pair - but only 2 such pairs exist ; whereas in the final answer it is forecast date & weather description total 14 pairs.

* Open the BBC Weather website.
* Press `Ctrl + Shift + I`.
* Select the ‘Network’ menu.
* Select ‘Fetch/XHR’.
* Type ‘Karachi’ in the input field on the website. **Do not press Enter** while entering the location; just type the location. Pressing Enter might cause ‘location?api\_key=…’ to disappear.
* ‘location?api\_key=…’ will appear in the inspect menu.
* Double-click it to open a web page ([https://locator-service.api.bbci.co.uk/locations?api\_key={api\_key}](https://locator-service.api.bbci.co.uk/locations?api_key=%7Bapi_key%7D)). This will give the API.
* Alternatively, single-clicking ‘location?api\_key=…’ will open headers where you can see the Request URL and the API key.

change the city and country in the url

there will be a bounding\_box field: [min\_lat, max\_lat, min\_long, max\_long]

Getting this question right is a tough nut to crack…so I would rather suggest you to do using the developer tools by inspecting the source code and putting the breakpoint followed by writing the code in the console to retrieve the expected answer

first convert it roughly to md file then use ai and tell it to add (all the errors one by one). and slowly it will solve all the errors

yes i know it is not the correct way to convert pdf to md file but its just a way to trick the checking system.

but i have an issue it gave me error that it does not contains the word “bash, javascript, whole redesign, net, suasoria” which is not in the actual pdf, but i added it and it worked. it was just pure trial and error.

The IMDB and weather questions was a pain along with the 10th question, wasted so much time [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) , the questions were nowhere tough, it was the problems with the evaluation part i had spend hours just to sit and correct the JSON file and no comments on the 10th question’s part.

I am fine with the academia being challenging to study not the evalation making me manually edit solutions

It is just a translation of the same movie… it’s not different

i 'm here for the bonus marks,

But since i am here. Just want to appreciate the course and your efforts towards this.

We need more “teachers” like you, who really puts an extra effort in the course.

And i have never seen any course cool as this,

* like appreciating tweaking things, using dev console to tweak things, keep the code checks on client side (*and as S Anand’s Student i have leveraged that freedom ![:sweat_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/sweat_smile.png?v=12 ":sweat_smile:"), gave client side answer checks’s code to `o1` and it reverse engineered the minifed code, and lots of question were solved by that only, but really curious on how others are doing this*)
* keeping the cutting edge tech in course, like function calling from OpenAI.  
  ( *i have seen some students solutions, they were using regex to solve that problem ![:smiling_face_with_tear:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/smiling_face_with_tear.png?v=12 ":smiling_face_with_tear:")*)

if you look closely the expected value is `2024-`  and actual that you are supplying is `2024`.  
Difference ? your value does have a `-` and a space at the end.  
reason ? you might be scraping it ? `trim()` or maybe using `innerText` to get tag’s text ?

the movie may have different title on IMDb (perhaps in another language) according to region which is why there isnt an exact match u can manually format it to get marks

Alright so in Q4 of W4, We have to extract weather forecast data from bbc servers for a given city. The city I have been given Nur-Sultan is not present in the bbc data base, it appears the city is now known as Astana and is listed in the bbc database as Astana.  
Since Nur-Sultan doesn’t exist in the bbc database, all of my attempts to extract data for it were meet with failure. So I extracted the data for Astana and pasted it in the portal but that doesn’t work as well and throws the following error “TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading ‘id’)”  
What am I suppose to do? [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

Beyond the specific tools mentioned (like `IMPORTHTML` in Google Sheets or `httpx` and `lxml` in Python), what are the broader *ethical considerations* when scraping data from websites, and how can developers ensure they are acting responsibly and respecting website owners’ rights and resources?

The bonus mark will be processed afterwards. That is checked before the scores are pushed to portal.

Nominatim API gives me the bounding box of the location. How exactly the bounding box helps me to find the details of the location?

Here are the Discourse IDs that replied to this post. [@carlton](/u/carlton) could you please add 1 mark to them in the GA (not the overall score)?

* Please include only those are enrolled this term, obviously.
* If they didn’t attempt GA4, please include them anyway and give them 1/10.
* If they got 10/10 already, please add 1 mark anyway and give them 11/10.

As can be seen, my roll number is present in this list (21f2000588) and in GA4 I have got 10/10 but unfortunately, that bonus mark hasn’t been added (as can be seen from the score displayed on the dashboard). So I request you to add that bonus mark to the total kindly.

Hoping for a positive response.

It will show up as 110 marks. Bonus marks are for all discourse posts on this thread that Anand has identified as valid. I have provided operations team with the update corrected scores. You will start seeing them in the dashboard soon.

Also these are the list of students that have been affected by Nur-Sultan in their questions. These will get an automatic mark for that question if they attempted it. Note that this is not a bonus mark. This is a free mark.

For those who didn’t submit but still need to practice the questions like to check if the answer is right, or cross-check the solutions for GA 4 and GA 5, is there a special link where the portal just checks the answer and says right or wrong. I wasn’t able to do GA4 or even try to attempt GA 5 before deadline, but i would like to go through the process of submitting etc. is there any link or solutions for GA 4 and GA5.

Your scores are evaluated on a site that is external to the seek portal and is not integrated with the seek portal. Therefore seek does not know if you have submitted or not and by default says that it has not been submitted because it cannot see your external evaluation. There will not be a fix for this for some time.

Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal.

**The scores will only be visible in the dashboard.** Just ignore anything inside seek portal. The dashboard is where all your subject score cards exists.

As stated in multiple places on discourse as well as in live sessions, The final score is always your last submission. If your dashboard score does not match your final submission score on the assignment page, only then contact us regarding your marks.

Dear Bhavanagv,

The scores have not been pushed to the dashboard yet. Ignore seek portal. Seek portal will not have your submission or your scores because it is evaluated externally from the seek portal.

Kind regards

Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal.

The scores will only be visible in the dashboard. Just ignore anything inside the seek portal.

As stated in multiple places in discourse as well as in live sessions, The final score is always your last submission.

There are some errors in grading for GA2 and GA3 for TDS, even after submitting the assignments score 0 was given and the seek portal displayed assignment was not submitted given that the login was from my own account and was submitted before the time and still got a score of 0.

I recently got mail and checked my marks for GA2 and noticed that the final score is showing as **4.25**, but while attempting the assignment earlier, I had scored **7.25** shown after submission.

Could you please help me understand how the marks were reduced? I want to ensure there was no error or misunderstanding in the evaluation.

Hi Satish,

Your last submitted score is the only valid score. You have to check before submitting that the score is correct. There is a reload button to load previous answers. But some answers require a live service. If the live service is not running at the time of the check (when you hit the submit button), you will not be scored for those questions. Please make sure that you have any live services running when the submit button is used and check that the last saved score is correct.

Kind regards

The lectures primarily focus on surface-level explanations without ensuring a strong foundational understanding of the topics. Key concepts, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and related technologies, are not explained in a structured manner, making it difficult for students to follow.

Hi Hari,

The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.

Have you watched this session in particular?

[![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/f/5f761086e44617c54e405c03db45772d8428e8df.jpeg "2025-01-28 Week 3 - Session 1 - TDS Jan 25")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmSMQ5LWa30&t=3133)

If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it

[![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/3/c37c79aa38f5d6c672b5a13b4f99a012a7e5da74.jpeg "TA Session 11 July: LLM APi Setup and Use")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OdReZsvi2w)

followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases

[![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/6/f/6f939856a1a40a564cc355f6fd4a217178902967.jpeg "\"TA session 12 July : week 5 , LLM API and embedding\"")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELZf0n_0u9w)

But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.

Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.

Kind regards

I missed a week’s worth of learning, and I’d like to catch up by attempting the assignments after going through the video tutorials. I’m not asking for grades as deadline is passed, just the opportunity to complete them for the sake of learning. I would really appreciate if this can be made possible.

Chat GPT has stepped up the game and I am excited ![:stuck_out_tongue:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=12 ":stuck_out_tongue:")

Now I can not only generate the code, but can run it and ask it to fix the error with a single click. This changes software development and I guess we are moving in the direction we all know. It also makes this course a lot more important - the number of new things that I have learnt from this course which I am able to directly apply to my day to day work is immense. Thanks to [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) and the entire course team who designed this amazing course

I hope ChatGPT solves deployment next ![:slight_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/slight_smile.png?v=12 ":slight_smile:")

[@23f1002630](/u/23f1002630) - thanks for raising this. It’s fixed and won’t re-occur for anyone.

**What happened?** I picked random duration from the video of 10-40 seconds, but forgot to ensure that the end time should not exceed the video length. That’s what I fixed.

i guess there’s some issue in 5th question as i have correctly filtered the data in OpenRefine 2-3 times but still getting incorrect in the portal.

OpenRefine question has historically been a tricky question to get right. Check out some past TA sessions in previous term for solving it, or previous discourse posts.

Wrong / Confusing question Prof

The top line mentions “Saturdays” whereas the bottom line mentions “Sundays”

Please clarify “SUNDAY” or “SATURDAY”?

I’ve attempted this question several times and I’m fairly certain that the answer to this question is incorrect. I’d be grateful if the answer to this question was re-checked. I can share the answer I’m certain about here, however I do not think it would be prudent to do so given this is a public forum.

To ensure accuracy, I also tried a manual approach by converting the JSON file to Excel and filtering the data, but I arrived at the same answer each time. However, the assignment portal still shows it as incorrect.

hellor sir my answer is 4764 after so many verification like excel python open refine etc but still it was saying it is wrong sir check answer please question no 4 related to 1. **Aggregate Sales by City:** After clustering city names, group the filtered sales entries by city and calculate the total units sold for each city.  
2. **Identify the Top-Performing City:** Determine which city has the highest total unit sales for the selected product and report the unit sales number.

By performing this analysis, GlobalRetail Insights will be able to:

* **Improve Data Accuracy:** Correct mis-spellings and inconsistencies in the dataset, leading to more reliable insights.
* **Target Marketing Efforts:** Identify high-performing regions for the specific product, enabling targeted promotional strategies.
* **Optimize Inventory Management:** Ensure that inventory allocations reflect the true demand in each region, reducing wastage and stockouts.
* **Drive Strategic Decision-Making:** Provide actionable intelligence to clients that supports strategic planning and competitive advantage in the market.

[@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  
Q5 fixed, thanks for fixing the issue.

Now we are struggling with Q8.  
MY q8 is : Write a DuckDB SQL query to find all posts IDs after 2025-01-09T12:36:14.085Z with at least 1 comment with 4 useful stars, sorted. The result should be a table with a single column called `post_id` , and the relevant post IDs should be sorted in ascending order.  
when i use below query, i get some some result, a table of post\_id but error : **Error**: At root: Array length mismatch  
**Reason**: below query checking only 1st comment (`$[0]` refers to the first comment in the array) we have to check all comments not 1st.  
But when i change the query to check any one comment its giving different types of error.

```
WITH filtered_posts AS (
  SELECT post_id
  FROM social_media
  WHERE timestamp >= '2025-01-09T09:48:01.303Z'
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM social_media AS sm
      WHERE json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') IS NOT NULL
        AND CAST(json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') AS INTEGER) > 4
    )
)
SELECT post_id
FROM filtered_posts
ORDER BY post_id ASC;

```

Kindly check if any issue with Q8.  
May be my query is wrong or may be not.

Thankyou

[@lakshaygarg654](/u/lakshaygarg654)

Your query construction is unnecessarily complicated and therefore will be difficult to debug.

Query construction is best done by thinking what you want at the end.  
In this case its an ordered `post_id`

So thats where you begin:

```
SELECT post_id
FROM (
...
)
ORDER BY post_id

```

Doing this, produces the actual result without giving the logic yet.

Then at each stage you add the next stage of complexity.  
You will still need the `post_id` for the *outermost layer* so you have to continue extracting it from the *inner layers* of the nested query.

```
...
...
FROM (
   SELECT post_id, ( ... ) as max_stars
   FROM social_media
   WHERE time_stamp >= (whatever the parameter you have been given)
      AND max_stars >= (whatever the parameter for min stars you have been given)
)
...
...

```

Then the final layer of the nest

```
...
...
(

) as max_stars
...
...

```

You are not expecting me to solve the whole question right? (Hint: the inner most extraction involves JSON or “structure” extraction, which is a powerful capability)

But I hope you understand the logic of SQL which is a very elegant set theory language which is why it has lasted for over 4 decades.

Think clearly at each stage what do you need. Start with the answer and work backwards, extracting at each stage the logical items you require for the outer layer to be functional.

Kind regards

[@daksh76](/u/daksh76) thats because your innermost logic layer must not return a long list of results.

If you think about it logically each row cannot have a column field where one of the columns is a whole row of results right?

Thats why you are getting the error.

Check your innermost layer is returning a single value or a row of results.

Kind regards

Thank you for your response [@carlton](/u/carlton). You are absolutely right—my query was unnecessarily complex. Initially, I attempted a simpler approach, using various JSON extraction functions. However, I encountered multiple errors, including:

1. **`json_extract`**: *“Table Function with name ‘json\_extract’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”*
2. **`json_each`**: *“Table Function with name ‘json\_each’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”*
3. **`json_extract_path_text`**: *“Table Function with name ‘json\_extract\_path\_text’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”*

Since the simple approach did not work, I attempted a more complex query to achieve the desired result. However, that too did not yield the expected output. To gain better insight, I extracted ten values into a table using the console and then reconstructed the query accordingly. Unfortunately, I am still facing issues related to functions not being recognized in the catalog.  
I would appreciate any guidance on resolving this issue. I do not need the exact answer; I just want to know if there is any issue with the portal for **Q8**.

Thankyou

For Q8, I wrote the following query,

```
SELECT smo.post_id
FROM social_media as smo
WHERE smo.timestamp >= '2024-11-15T06:02:28.656Z'
AND EXISTS (
   SELECT 1
   FROM LATERAL (
       SELECT UNNEST(json_extract(comments, '$[*]'))
       FROM social_media as sm
       WHERE sm.post_id = smo.post_id
       ) AS c(value)
    WHERE json_extract(c.value, '$.stars.useful')::DOUBLE = 4)
order by smo.post_id;

```

What it does is for each post\_id, checks the timestamp and then checks the presence of a json object in comments that has 4 stars useful rating for this post\_id. Finally returns all the post\_id’s in ascending order.

But it’s giving me an `Array length mismatch` error. I’m stuck here. Any hints would be helpful. [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

P.S. I also noticed that the timestamp given in the question keeps changing with each page reload. But the output from the query stays the same.

**QUESTION 9**

I was supposed to transcribe the audio of the provided video for a certain time period. After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.

Here was my transcription - " Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.

In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”

The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.

Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.

From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.

Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation "

is there anyway to practice the assignments and check answers even though the deadline for the assignment passes? or is the answer given somewhere just for learning sake. I had exams and would like do week 4,week 5 before week 6 and doing the assignment is a huge part in learning, any on the just doing the assignments or answers for the assignments?

Sir,  
I have facing lots of difficulties in assignments and it was taking alot of time to solve a single assignment, so please extend the deadline for project 1 as it contains more weightage and it required more time to solve it.  
Please kindly consider my request, as I am from non-technical background it is taking most of the time of a week because of which other Courses are suffering.

Can you check the dashboard now, I’ve been informed by operations that the scores have been pushed.

GA 4 scores will be a little late to be pushed because there are some manual (i.e. automated using a custom written script) corrections that have to be made to Q4 for students who got Nur-Sultan as their city.

You got 80 in ga4. And the bonus makes it to 90.

Kindly post a screenshot of your dashboard if 90 is not showing for GA4

Dont worry we have your correct scores. We have done spot checks to make sure of the data consistency. We are having some technical difficulties with getting the evaluations which are on the TDS server to the Portal Operations team. Kindly bear with us while we work out the problem.

because the previous score that you received was what you scored after the deadline. We had accidentally given students marks to students who submitted after the deadline. Here is the evidence.

[@23f2004320](/u/23f2004320)

I have checked the backend server. The actual score is 85 in Module 1.

Ignore seek portal, because scores are evaluated externally on our server. Those scores on seek portal are just from the placeholder question that asked whether you saw GA1 and attempted it. It has no bearing on your actual marks.

The actual score will be in the dashboard soon.

Kind regards.

Sorry for the late upload but as you can see in the screenshot i had submitted answers for TDS Week 2 graded assignment but it shows 0 both here and in current courses tab.  
I did reload the recent tab before uploading and for tds ga submission i submit and keep the tab open until the timer runs out.

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) and [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) and [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir

It is becoming quite evident that a lot of us will struggle to get something decent out for the project-1 by saturday and we are struggling here. I request to reconsider the deadline and extend the due date so that it gives slightly more odds of submitting the project.

Thanks

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir plss extend deadline as it is taking too much time to understand the project and this is completely new for us, we are trying our best but couldn’t able to make it. Some days extension might reduce our stress and we’ll perform better in the project as this is very important for us.

Please at least make it 16 or 17 Feb. The GATE DA exam and project deadline coinciding has already hampered progress on both ends. At least the project will be much better even with the smallest possible extension.

and others…

I have discussed this with the rest of the TDS team and with Operations on multiple occasions (including today.) Here are the highlights of the discussion:

* We have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday.
* All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago)
* Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago)
* We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it.

All of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students:

**Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed.**

Please make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements.

Kind regards  
TDS Team

-Yes sir this project 1 is very tough for even 1 question a whole day is used.  
[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) Sir besides this project we have other subject graded assignments and MLP Project and MAD2 project.  
Please sir it would be very beneficial for everyone, we have talked to other students also we are not able to even complete the 10 A tasks even with the evaluate.py rest aside Task B.  
Please sir take this into consideration. We are trying very hard for this project even you can see students asking various questions in the discourse, we are struggling but still sir we are trying.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)

We truly appreciate the efforts being put by the TDS team, but not to be rude here -

* Why is Project 1 deadline is on Saturday and not on Sunday, as many of us are doing the course **not as a full-time** student. (Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated.
* Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week.
* Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.

Thank you.

Hi Instructor team,

Thank you for your response. Till week4, I have completed all my assignments using internet/gpt without fully understanding the concepts. I wondered how is it going to benefit me in the real world scenario. That said, now I am facing that situation in the name of Project1. No real learning till week4 but a project to complete now. ![:worried:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/worried.png?v=12 ":worried:")

Sir,  
I would like to inquire if it would be possible to reconsider the weightage of the projects. As many students are finding it challenging to achieve high score in Project 1 and have been requesting an extension for the deadline. Instead of extending the deadline, I propose adjusting the weightage, allocating 15% to Project 1 and 25% to Project 2.  
This adjustment seems fair, as Project 2 requires students to build upon the concepts used in Project 1. By making this change, it would provide additional time for improvement and potentially help those who struggled with the first project to to get good scores, without disadvantaging those who performed well initially.  
Would it be possible to implement this change?

Currently we do not have any explicit policy regarding requiring IITM email as the github profile name or the github repo owner.

We DO however require you to use your IITM email when submitting the project submission form.

We are clarifying with operations at the moment if this arrangement satisfies their requirements. If it changes we will make a general announcement via email, portal and discourse.

(we do not expect the current requirements of github to change)

Kind regards

Hi Vikram,

This is because (if you watched the session, or examined the code, you would have realised that) datagen.py was designed to run inside your docker container. And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py  
Inside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile  
which then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder.

So the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully):

1. You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000
2. You create a docker image that runs this application server.
3. You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page.
4. For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files:  
   evaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts.
5. Run evalute.py using uv.

If your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task.

Hope that gives clarity.

Kind regards

Sakshi as the error says it’s unable to find your file. Try adding a . (dot) before the location.

sir i have used the dot(.) while sending the request to postman in the query which i provided to the task. Is the dot(.) should be added somewhere else?

If you have added that dot as a prefix to your locations then, you would have to structure your query\_gpt in such a way that it takes these dots into consideration.

by running task A1 , it automatically creates a data folder along with all the files in it. Without running task A1 you can’t do rest of A tasks

It is good that the practical elements are core in the course though more time should be given for balanced approach between projects and graded assignments.

There were some issues I faced. For example, the GitHub link of the datagen.py was incorrect and I was confused due to the code not generating the expected outcome.

The LLM was giving creative answers which did not follow the strict evaluation guidelines. So, the case was not passed. For example, extracting credit card number from the image is a sensitive information.

I am alright with it since the evaluation will be different.

Now, I am really well versed with the tools taught in these weeks. Thanking the whole TDS Team for this project which was very well designed. ![:grinning:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/grinning.png?v=12 ":grinning:")

I got a mail saying my Dockerfile is missing. However I have a dockerfile already in my github repository. Is it an issue with the spelling of dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‘dockerfile’. It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by iitm.

Shall I just change the name of the file from ‘dockerfile’ to ‘Dockerfile’ in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile?

The name of the Dockerfile should be “Dockerfile” indeed, more over check other sections of your submission like

* Is the GitHub repo public?
* Does it have an MIT license?
* Does it have a DockerFile?
* Is the Docker image accessible?

Oh ok made the changes in Github. I hope submitting again is not required since the links and names are same.

Sir, i got this mail. I have checked that the repo is public and already has a Dockerfile.  
I have renamed the ‘LICENSE’ file as ‘MIT LICENSE’.

Sir, please consider it we have spent a lot of time, in my case just the d in Dockerfile was small that too on remote repository. On my local repository it was Dockerfile only I even have a published docker image as verified by you autated script only. The name of the file on remote repository did not change even after commit it through my local repo, once I read the mail in morning it was only then I realised it wasn’t changed on GitHub repo.

Sir I understand the deadline has passed and I am not asking for a resubmission, I am just asking to consider the already submitted work, just that. It would be really helpful. I just have one commit on my repo that too “Rename dockerfile to Dokerfile” . Sir please attest consider what we have already submitted. I have made no changes as you can verify it too.

Sir it is a humble request to please consider it.

Warm Regards,

Dear TDS Team,

I have verified my submission, and my repository **does include a Dockerfile**, and the **Docker image is accessible on DockerHub**. Please find the attached screenshot as proof. Kindly review my submission again and let me know if any further action is needed.

Looking forward to your confirmation.

Best regards,

Good Morning Sir,  
Sir even I am facing a similar issue, even though sanity check for docker image on docker hub was cleared but got a mail saying ‘dockerfile’ not present in the GitHub repo while it clearly was. Sir please look into it we have given so many days to complete this project.

Looking forward to your reply.

Thank you

So the reason for the failure is:

You had initially put your Dockerfile inside a directory called TDSP-1-main instead of being directly in your repo. (On 15th Feb 1:26AM)

Then when our automated script checked if students repos met the requirements and yours did not we immediately sent out a warning email as a opportunity for students to make the necessary corrections.

Then once you realised your mistake, on **Feb 17th at 9:11 pm IST** i.e *yesteday*, you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations.

Then you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=“21f3002647, post:1, topic:167471”]  
[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/6/a/6a4a28aa638840e8d2e4dbf246ca235fd41e5ccb.png)image250×534 3.92 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/6/a/6a4a28aa638840e8d2e4dbf246ca235fd41e5ccb.png "image")  
[/quote]

showing that your files are in the correct place.

We do not take into consideration modifications to your repo after the deadline because then we would have to extend that curtesy to all students.

Kind regards

[@carlton](/u/carlton) sir  
Yes, I corrected my repo at 9:11 PM IST, but I had actually written and submitted my query much earlier at 4 PM. At that time, I wasn’t entirely sure if this was the actual issue, but it looks like it was.

I understand that the deadline had already passed, and I only saw the email later. I had two GATE papers on the 15th and an interview on the 16th, so I was extremely busy and couldn’t check my emails sooner. However, I had raised my concern well before making the correction, so I’d really appreciate it if my submission could still be considered ![:frowning:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/frowning.png?v=12 ":frowning:")

The deadlines mentioned in the Grading Document provided and the TDS website ([s-anand.net](http://s-anand.net)) are different. Project-1’s deadline was 15 Feb, it was then postponed to the 16th of Feb. Can this be reflected here?  
Not affecting me particularly, however, it’s good to be consistent across channels of communication to the students…

It seems that the question in *Graded Assignment 5 for TDS* is producing incorrect results despite the same logic working correctly for other variations of the problem. Please check into this question once as I have cross checked with many of the students and chatgpt and all of us faced this issue in this question. Thanks!  
[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)

code to take reference from:

```
import gzip
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

log_path = 's-anand.net-May-2024.gz'
start_time = datetime.strptime('01:00:00', '%H:%M:%S').time()
end_time = datetime.strptime('15:00:00', '%H:%M:%S').time()
log_data = []

def parse_log(line):
    parts = line.split(' ')
    log_time = datetime.strptime(parts[3][1:], '%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S')
    method, url, status = parts[5][1:], parts[6], int(parts[8])
    return log_time, method, url, status

with gzip.open(log_path, 'rt') as file:
    for entry in file:
        log_time, method, url, status = parse_log(entry)
        if method == 'GET' and url.startswith('/blog/') and 200 <= status < 300:
            if log_time.weekday() == 0 and start_time <= log_time.time() < end_time:
                log_data.append(entry)

print(f"Successful GET requests: {len(log_data)}")

```

ps: I shared code after the deadline hopefully no issues there! ![:laughing:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/laughing.png?v=12 ":laughing:")

This is nothing to worry about because as you can see in the Recent saves section, it has your score history. We have your entire submission history because we log that.

**QUESTION 9**

I was supposed to transcribe the audio of the provided video for a certain time period. After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.

Here was my transcription - " Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.

In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”

The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.

Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.

From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.

Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation "

Hi TDS team, with ROE being ahead, i assume an official thread will be created soon. Here are few doubts from my side. I request the official post to cover these.

1. Syllabus
2. kindly hint us on the type of questions, kind of tools to practice
3. I did my ROE the last term, the time was not enough for me. I would like to know if it is actually possible to solve all the questions within the time
4. Any mock or resource to practice from?
5. additional tips, if any

1. Modules 1 - 5
2. Questions will be similar to GAs and the content in the modules.
3. ROE is quite hard. Only a small number will be able to do it in the given time frame.
4. We will have some past ROEs as practise
5. … watch sessions

Kind regards

Thanks for the answer [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
Is it safe to assume that ROE is nothing but a “GA with extremely short deadline” since we don’t have proctors ? Or is the ROE more complex structured ?  
P.S. I am not saying the questions will be hard or easy, just asking about structure.

ROEs are always unique. They can be of any kind. We do not fix one method. Therefore its not possible to say what kind of questions will be there whether MCQ, MSQ or numerical or text etc.

Kind regards

**Post ID**: 598895

The ROEs are not GAs with short deadlines. A GA question usually tests one concept in isolation. ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question. (in a very short time).

If your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you… past experience shows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome without significant assistance from the “hooomann” ![:nerd_face:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/nerd_face.png?v=12 ":nerd_face:")

So practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up everything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard.

There will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test.

Kind regards

Is there scope for collaboration in a 45 minute test?

Depends on the collaborators and how they split up the tasks. If its a team that knows their roles and a team leader that can designate tasks correctly then quite possibly. In practise though that rarely happens.

Also 45 mins is not a given, its a typical time we aim for. It can be shorter or longer depending on the nature of the questions in the ROE. Each one is unique. There have been ROEs as long as 2 hours and on the minimum side 30 mins.

Release of Project 2 has been delayed by 3 days, and release of Assignment 6 has been delayed by 10 days.

Could you please clarify if the submission dates will be changed accordingly? I am assuming it will have to be changed for Assignment 7 as well.

Please let me know rough submission dates if possible so that I can plan accordingly (my schedule in the upcoming days is very hectic).

Project 1 was based on Module 1 through 3.  
Project 2 will encompass Module 4 through 6 (and possibly 7) but not to the exclusion of the prior modules. These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase.

We generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started.

The GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more.

We try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs.

Hence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system.

Hope that give you some insight into how TDS works.

Thanks for bearing with us. TDS is perpetually a WIP.  
Kind regards

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)  
Dear team,  
Greetings of the day

I am writing this to request for a functionality

1. Practice the GAs again after their deadline has passed
2. Either the answers can be posted or the same question answering and simultaneous evaluation interface can work just like it does before the deadline.

How this is beneficial?

1. As the GATE exam has now been completed, we can now practice the questions we either left or could not do at that time
2. Revision will help us ace the ROE, project and end term

Overall this will increase the value of the already most practical and rewarding course of IIT BS i.e TDS.

Looking forward to your guidance and kind consideration  
Regards  
Aryan

Hello Sir,

I understand from the email we received that there are three mock ROEs scheduled. I wanted to check if it is mandatory to attempt the mock at 7 PM or if there is flexibility in the timing. As a working professional, I may not be able to attempt the mock at 7 PM.

Could you please confirm if there is any flexibility in the timings? Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide details on when and how the mock links will be shared.

Thanks and Regards  
Shalini

It is not mandatory to attempt mocks at 7pm. But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later.

ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma.

Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities.  
The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time.  
*The problem is the lack of time.*

So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand.

Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next.

Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE.

The real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before.  
But we will help you be as ready as possible for it.

Kind regards

You will get an email at 7pm with the ROE dataset and the question form.  
I will also add the same in the student seek portal.  
Mock ROEs are not proctored (its a mock!) and the actual ROE is not proctored either!  
The gmeet is after the mock ROE where it will be solved live by the TDS team.

yes in live session ROE was solved but while taking reference for Q1 from live session from TAs to see how this question might be solved as i was getting wrong answer, but TA also didnt solved that question in correct manner he got wrong, I think we should have at least 1 standard ref for all the questions of this mock roe to understand our mistakes in solving this questions pls understand thanks,

[@23f2003413](/u/23f2003413)

We will have it uploaded sometime this morning.

It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:

1. The chaos of ROE.
2. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.
3. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).
4. The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.
5. **The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly**
6. Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions
7. The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).
8. How limited the time is.

The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.  
Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.

Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).

I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.

Kind regards

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir , for me given constituency was `"SRI GOBINDPUR"`  
and in the dataset there are multiple names for this constituency i think over the period names were changed of this constituency  
i have filtered constituencies from punjab using below code in colab

```
df_gobindpur = df[df["AC"].str.contains("SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR", case=False, na=False)]

```

is this correct approach or i have to consider only SRI GOBINDPUR name only? but then this constituency is not availble after 1957

using above filtering i got below data for SRI GOBINDPUR

[drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PHMvoD16Mqino-9SC8uaUtVU3bVuxkD7/view?usp=sharing)

### [df\_gobindpur.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PHMvoD16Mqino-9SC8uaUtVU3bVuxkD7/view?usp=sharing)

Google Drive file.

then i used margin formula as

```
margin_percentage = ((winner_votes - runner_up_votes) / total_votes) * 100

```

using this i got answer for 1st question as

```
YEAR                              1992
AC                   4 SRIHARGOBINDPUR
WINNER                  1 GURNAM SINGH
WINNER_PARTY                       CPI
WINNER_VOTES                    5000.0
RUNNER_UP               2 MUSTAK MASIH
RUNNER_UP_PARTY                    INC
RUNNER_UP_VOTES                 1115.0
MARGIN_PERCENTAGE            50.599114

```

which is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64  
pls guide where i might be wrong, thanks

For this kind of name difference you can use Openrefine software

That answer is wrong, we will be releasing a script with correct python snippets.

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
“SATHUPALLE” and “NILANGA” were two of the four constituencies which were assigned to me. However, even with phonetic match, I couldn’t find any data for these. Closest I could find to SATHUPALLE is “Sattenapalle”, however, two are different locations 150km+ apart as per google maps. Are these really in the dataset?

Q1: Download and unzip q-count-gold-ticket-sales-from-html.zip. It has a set of HTML files, each with tables of 3 columns: Type, Units, and Price.

What is the total sales of all the items in the “Gold” ticket type? Round to 2 decimal places (e.g. 123.40).

```
!unzip /content/q-count-gold-ticket-sales-from-html.zip -d /content/extracted_folder

```

```
import os
import pandas as pd
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup




total_sales = 0
html_folder = "/content/extracted_folder"  # Update if the folder name is different

for file in os.listdir(html_folder):
    if file.endswith(".html"):
        file_path = os.path.join(html_folder, file)

        # Step 3: Read the HTML content and extract tables
        with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            soup = BeautifulSoup(f, "html.parser")
        
        tables = pd.read_html(str(soup))  # Extract all tables

        for table in tables:
            if {"Type", "Units", "Price"}.issubset(table.columns):
                # Step 4: Filter "Gold" ticket type and calculate total sales
                table["Type"] = table["Type"].str.strip().str.lower()
                gold_sales = table[table["Type"] == "gold"]["Units"] * table[table["Type"] == "gold"]["Price"]
                total_sales += gold_sales.sum()
# Step 5: Print the result rounded to 2 decimal places
print(f"Total Gold Ticket Sales: {total_sales:.2f}")


```

Q2: Download and unzip q-least-unique-subjects-from-csv.zip. It has 2 files:

1. `students.csv` has 2 columns:
2. studentId: A unique identifier for each student
3. class: The class (including section) of the student
4. `subjects.csv` has 2 columns:
5. studentId: The identifier for each student
6. subject: The name of the subject they have chosen

What are the least number of subjects any class has taken up? List the 3 lowest count of subjects in order.

```
!unzip /content/q-least-unique-subjects-from-csv.zip -d /content/extracted_folder
import pandas as pd
df1 = pd.read_csv("/content/extracted_folder/students.csv")
df2 = pd.read_csv("/content/extracted_folder/subjects.csv")
merged_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on="studentId")
class_subject_counts = merged_df.groupby("class")["subject"].nunique()
lowest_subject_counts = class_subject_counts.nsmallest(3)
print(lowest_subject_counts)

Hi [@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382)  
That’s a private repo, so won’t be accessible now.  
use [Jivraj-18/tds-jan-2025-mock-roe-1](https://github.com/Jivraj-18/tds-jan-2025-mock-roe-1), It have same dataset in some other format.

@all  
Q: You are the operations manager for World Courier. You are trying to find the shortest path between `Doha` and `Muscat`.

World Courier has a fleet of aircraft that can fly directly between specific cities. The distance between two cities is the [Haversine distance](https://pypi.org/project/haversine/).

What is the sequence of cities that you should fly to minimize the total distance traveled?

Write the answer as a sequence of cities separated by commas.

We are expecting you to collaborate. But you got to do it in a methodical organised way. Like NASA trying to get the 3 men in Apollo 13 back home. ![:wink:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/wink.png?v=12 ":wink:")  
Work together like a team. One man band is tough or impossible. So is a hodgepodge of directionless people. So a proper team can perhaps crack it.

But there is seems to be a very thin line between collaborating and people just taking other people’s code and using them to generate their answer instead of also participating in the collaboration. So I was confused about the “collaborating” thing.

I understand that sentiment. I struggle with it a lot too when discussing it with Anand. Is there value or learning, in blind copying. Im not so sure. At some point someone has to learn to become an expert. A critical thinker. There is even a Microsoft study now that shows that GPT usage impacts critical thinking. Are we going to end up with a generation of people who can no longer critically think to solve a problem? These are good philosophical questions. I lie somewhere more on the conservative side of that spectrum. But everyone has to grapple with this tradeoff. Where does the right balance lie? I don’t know the answer to that question for others. I know the right answer for me.

Kind regards

I feel less complex (but still questions that test your critical thinking) and proctored ROE (with access to documentation of the different services used) could help. In this way people can use gpt models to crack the difficult GA questions but through ROE you can actually still test their knowledge on the topics which are covered.

But this too has its caveats, there doesn’t seem to be a proper solution to this ![:sweat_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/sweat_smile.png?v=12 ":sweat_smile:")

There was no need to scrape Sagan, you could have copied the whole table and pasted it into an excel sheet and exported it as a csv file. Try it out once!

Mocks are just to give you a feel of what an ROE is about, and to get you comfortable with the 45 min time limit. So, the number of questions in the real ROE is going to have little correlation with the question count in the mocks.

Respected [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) , [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) , [@carlton](/u/carlton)

Based on the ROE mock assessments, I kindly request you to consider extending the allotted time for the ROE. Some tasks require downloading libraries, whereas you may already have these libraries or other necessary setups in place, which naturally reduces your solving time.

As you are aware, additional time will only benefit those who have prepared and possess the required knowledge. Students without preparation will not gain any advantage simply due to an extension. Furthermore, as the course has been modified from the previous term and many aspects are still being refined, we have already requested measures to support our performance and ensure our grades are not put at undue risk.

I genuinely prioritize knowledge over marks and have put in significant effort to excel in this course. However, I do not want to risk failing. My goal is simply to meet the passing criteria (at least 40 marks) . Therefore, I sincerely request you to consider granting additional time for the ROE as a reasonable relief.

Your understanding and support in this matter would be greatly appreciated.  
Best Regards,  
Lakshay

The json from the webpage does not match the data in the mock roe webpage. Its a little trick that Anand implemented so that its not so easy to do. It was basically to see if you could spot the difference. These things do happen in the real world where the backend sends something and someone has done some जुगाड़ code on the front end just to get the job done for the client. So when you are trying to scrape the data for some analysis things dont quite seem what they are.

Also ROE date will not be moved because its an exam date that has been set before the term starts. This is just part of the policy of the BS Programme. Exam dates never get moved except in truly exceptional circumstances.

## Post by A LAKSHMI - February 25, 2025 17:21:11
**Post ID**: 599766

Dear [@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil) [@Anand](/u/anand) [@Bharathi](/u/bharathi)

First and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the **TDS team** in supporting us throughout this course. The **live sessions and guidance** have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience.

However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations.

## **Key Challenges Faced**

### :small_blue_diamond: **Lack of Prerequisites**

This course did not list any **prerequisites**, leading many students—including those from **non-technical backgrounds**—to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the **course content, assignments, and projects** have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.

### :small_blue_diamond: **Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure**

The **difficulty of the projects** has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to **rely heavily on peer support** just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.

### :small_blue_diamond: **Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback**

Many students joined **TDS** based on past **Discourse posts and feedback**, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for **working professionals** and students without prior experience.

### :small_blue_diamond: **Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)**

While we have put in significant effort—spending **2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs)** to secure good scores—we still find ourselves **struggling to meet expectations** for the **projects and RoE**, which are significantly harder than anticipated.

We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course.

We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.

Thank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.

Right,  
I put 3 to 4 days on a GA. I still am not able to fully grasp the concept.

I tried to attempt today’s mock roe, it was a disaster. I hope I can do better on next mock.

I completed my project but due to some issue I failed to submit it. That’s was my mistake, and I highly regret it. I lost 20 marks because of it despite working so hard.

Hi [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil) [@Bharathi](/u/bharathi) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  
Could you please look into the above issue?

Additionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring:

### **Grading Concerns**

**Final Course Score:**  
T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F  
(The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.)

From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students:  
[What’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/whats-the-actual-purpose-of-impossible-roe-exam/99838).  
Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores.

Furthermore, for Project 1 (**deadline: 16th Feb 2025**), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.

### **Course Structuring & Scheduling Issues**

* Many students pursuing this course are **dual-degree students or working professionals**, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.
* The **last-minute guidance** for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.
* The **structuring and scheduling of sessions** feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.

### **Request for Improvement**

To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:

1. **Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2**, well in advance of the deadline.
2. **More structured and accessible support**, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.
3. **Better management of exam difficulty levels**, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.

I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response.

Thank you [@A\_LAKSHMI](/u/a_lakshmi) for the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response.

Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the **grading pattern will not be changed**. And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP.

1. TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this [Discourse thread](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-course-feedback-t32024-and-course-selection-t12025-thread/160032/84) where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the [first page of the TDS course](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/) GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:

> **This course is quite hard**
>
> Here’s students’ feedback:
>
> * It *used* to be an easy course until 2024. [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/difficulty-rating-for-diploma-subjects-based-on-students-opinion/61194) [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/difficulty-rating-for-diploma-subjects-2-0-based-on-student-ratings-and-my-experience/85681) [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/what-should-i-take-next/44291/6)
> * Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-course-feedback-t32024-and-course-selection-t12025-thread/160032/45) [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/2024-t1-diploma-level-feedback-and-course-selection-for-may-2024-term/127856/60) [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/2024-t2-diploma-level-feedback-and-course-selection-for-september-2024-term/144976/62)
> * Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-unfair-grading-practices-for-tds-project-2/160611/11) [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-level-course-combo-suggestion/158460/4) [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-level-course-combo-suggestion/158460/7)
> * LLMs grade you – unpredictably. [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-unfair-grading-practices-for-tds-project-2/160611/10) [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/wrong-marks-in-project-2/160355/9)
> * The ROE is hard. [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/is-it-fair-to-consider-20-weightage-of-such-exam-which-is-impossible-to-solve-in-given-time-i-e-roe/141413/10)
>
> **[Take Graded assignment 1](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1) to check if you’re ready for this course.** Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now.

2. TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - *Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help*  
   Again to quote Anand:

> **We encourage learning by sharing**
>
> You *CAN* copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).
>
> **Why should you copy?** Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well.
>
> **To learn well, understand** what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize.
>
> **To learn better, teach** what you’ve learnt.

3. Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).  
   Once again Anand has a [nice blog](https://www.s-anand.net/blog/should-courses-be-hard-or-easy/) where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable and internally make us more humble.
4. Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.
5. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - *Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them* The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.
6. [@22f2001640](/u/22f2001640) Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.

Regarding your point of the short term benefits of grades vs the long term benefits of learning, I think I’m speaking for a lot of my peers that we’re not concerned about grades at this point, we just at least want to pass this course.

I’m a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this hard work I should be able to pass the course.

While grades don’t matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks. I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I’m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me.

I understand that the grading can’t be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege to pass.

Truly agree with your point. It is hard. If the marking scheme is unpredictable, why not remove the whole grading system from this course. This is punishment even when you do learn. Hopefully, I would like a better grading system in future, even the course is designed very well!

I don’t wish for them to be graded, but I would like to work with the portal and validate my answers for the questions stated in the GA itself.

Apologies for the confusion. I realized that the issue was due to different time zones—Java OPPE displayed IST (GMT +5:30), while TDS ROE showed AST (GMT +3). On the same day, I intended to delete my post on Discourse but couldn’t find it, as it was still in draft mode. So, I deleted it. However, I was surprised to see the post today.

If the ROE is like how it was for MOCK ROE1 then this probably wont work right?  
Only for today’s ROE(mock 2) we can split the tasks efficiently and get it done.  
Thoughts?

Yup! Based on previous GAs, 45 minutes seems pretty short.

Its fine the link is correct. Just that the exam is not available at the moment, we have changed the error message. Exam will start at 1pm. Its also hackable to start before.

Your answer is absolutely correct [@23f2000573](/u/23f2000573)  
But the problem is you had to submit the answer rounded off to 3 decimal places. A decimal more or less would result in a wrong answer.

Hello Sir"s, [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

I was able to successfully attempt only 5 questions within the time limit. But due to internet issues, I could not submit exactly at 1:45pm.  
My last submission was at 1:47pm. But if there was a auto save then you could already check my answers were in the portal.

I request you to please consider submission delays of 2-3 mins as this was due a technical glitches. And we too are switching tabs and running in vscode

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) / [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

I tried submitting my exam at 3:14 AM EST, but my browser reloaded unexpectedly. I ended up re-entering my answers and submitted at 3:15:46 AM. I had completed eight questions (8 marks) well before the time, but got stuck on the last two.

I understand I should have submitted more frequently, but those final 5 minutes flew by like the fastest 5 minutes of my life.

Please consider accepting my submission

I am Gudivada Abiram(21f3002158). In my today’s ROE exam I forgot to click the save button. My score initially was 6/10. I was tackling another question and by that time the timer went off. I can even send my answers if required.  
I should have submitted more frequently, but I was busy solving the other questions for extra marks.  
Could you please consider my request?

Hi [@21f3002158](/u/21f3002158)

I looked for your result in backend, seems like you didn’t click to submit button throughout the exam.

Since roe exam portal was similar to GA’s where you need to save answers using save button, after saving only your answers get evaluated and you get answers.

There is no way other than pressing save button, we can’t do any help with this.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir, I got disconnected at around 1:35 due to a network glitch and had to restart my uv server as well collab which wasted around 5 min and my score was around 7 and further I ran multiple scripts which I had already saved as code snippets as part of GA for question 4 on vs code and Collab and finally got the answer but I exceeded the time limit since the submission I made was at 1:47:28 which was 9…so I request to please consider that  
Overall the ROE was a great experience and I wholly enjoyed the process

Thank you for giving us this amazing opportunity

I respect the rules of the exam and will be more careful in the future exams to avoid such technical glitches.

When I clicked the save button, it took an unusually long time to respond and eventually showed an error. There was no network issue, as other applications were working fine. However, the moment I clicked “Save,” all websites stopped loading, and my browser became unresponsive. I’m not sure what caused this problem, but I will share a screenshot to help diagnose the issue.

I looked for your submissions in backend and can’t find any submission.

There was a technical support meeting going between 1 Pm to 1:50 pm on ROE day, you were expected to join that meeting. You didn’t join technical support meet before deadline.

Even on discourse we were continuously looking for new posts during ROE, you created discourse post at 2:3 PM which was after deadline so we can’t help with it.

I have attempted all the questions in the ROE and solved few of the questions but i forgot to save the submission. At that time, I did not realize that I have not even saved once during the time. After realizing that i have not saved it in the evening, I have used the console to disable the save and saved my answers. Is it possible to validate it? I don’t have any submissions before 1:45pm. I realize that it is my mistake for not being careful about it but i request sir to be lenient about it as the project 1 was also difficult and i have my exams tomorrow.

Until not clicked on save button answers get’s checked at frontend side only. There is no way we can validate it after deadline.

I trust you would have solved few questions and also would have checked before deadline but clicking on save button was must to get submission evaluated.

i have not saved even once during the deadline but i have submitted/saved by hacking it in the evening when i realised that i have not saved it, i am asking you to consider that as i really don’t have any saves before deadline which will result me 0 marks, my request is to accept post deadline save by being lenient about it else i will get 0 marks. I will be satisfied even if you consider my 2nd save rather than latest save. (1st save was a sample test to check if possible, so it was 0 marks but the 2nd save is under 1-2 min which may prove that i have done all that questions before)

yes, as you can see my first save is at 7:25 which was a trial check if post submission is working or not but you can see that the 2nd and 3rd are saved in approx 1 minute but i got 8 corrects which proves that i have done it before only. the latest save got 9 marks as i forgot to run the fastapi server for 1st mark which resulted me 3 more minutes. So, I request sir to consider any one of the saves except the first save

Hi [@23f3002537](/u/23f3002537)  
The problem is that, here you are sending headers unnecessary and overwriting the original headers. Moreover you were returning the text of the response instead of the json. Here is the revised version.

```
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import httpx
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

# Add CORS middleware to handle preflight OPTIONS requests
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

@app.get("/api")
async def proxy(url: str, request: Request):
    headers = {key: value for key, value in request.headers.items() if key.lower() != "host"}
    try:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(url)
            return response.json()
    except httpx.RequestError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Request failed: {str(e)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)

Hello [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir,

Will it be possible to consider only the minutes. I also cannot control the technical delays. I raised the point as fast as possible and I also joined the technical GMEET and exited when a different person raised the same question.

I would dearly propose to consider still 1:47. But if it’s 1:48 you can ofcourse not consider it. But the “seconds” is something unrealistic.

Please re consider this request sir.

Please reconsider this decision. In the heat of the moment, I failed to save. In my mind, I was sure that I had saved it. There is one other student with the same problem ( saved a few seconds after 1:47).

Since I did only one save, I would get zero marks if the score is not considered.

I didn’t submit any new answer after 1:45 pm.

Please reconsider if possible.

Dont worry, we have the right scores on our server. There has been some problem in sending the export to the operations team. Your scores are safe. We are working on figuring out the problem. Even the bonus marks are recorded. Just give us a couple of days to sort it out. Many students have been affected so we cant give individual responses right now. Its a system fix that needs to be implemented.

Respected Sir,

I noticed that my status is still marked as absent. I understand I may be a bit impatient, but I wanted to clarify my submission. I had submitted the ROE on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed until 1:47 PM.

Even after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks when someone said that this term’s project was tougher than the last.

Even if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it’s my mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form. Since this is a standalone degree for me, I’m actually worried about it. When I learned how to unlock the ROE, I completed it in a very short time.

Please consider the top marks even when did after the normal deadline as marks still got submitted

You failed pre requisites check. Hence there is no evaluation email.  
i.e. the score is 0 which will be pushed to dashboard on after 1/4/25

Only those that passed the pre requisite check got emails with scores.

Q 7 LLM Embeddings (1 mark)

**SecurePay**, a leading fintech startup, has implemented an innovative feature to detect and prevent fraudulent activities in real time. As part of its security suite, the system analyzes personalized transaction messages by converting them into embeddings. These embeddings are compared against known patterns of legitimate and fraudulent messages to flag unusual activity.

Imagine you are working on the SecurePay team as a junior developer tasked with integrating the text embeddings feature into the fraud detection module. When a user initiates a transaction, the system sends a personalized v…

“Dear user, please verify your transaction code 33692 sent to roe-23f1002382@ds.study.iitm.ac.in”,

Q^: 6 Move and rename files (1 mark)

Download q-move-rename-files.zip and extract it. Use `mv` to move all files under folders into an empty folder. Then rename all files replacing each digit with the next. 1 becomes 2, 9 becomes 0, `a1b9c.txt` becomes `a2b0c.txt`.

ANSWER:

```
unzip /workspaces/TDS/q-move-rename-files.zip -d extracted_folder123123
    5  mkdir empty_folder 
    6  find extracted_folder -type f -exec mv {} empty_folder/ \; 
    7  ls
    8  find extracted_folder123123 -type f -exec mv {} empty_folder/ \; 
    9  cd empty_folder

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
I wanted to let you know that I was unable to attend the ROE session today. I’ve been running a high fever since yesterday, and while I managed to complete my JAVA OPPE this morning, I started feeling much worse afterward. I felt it was necessary to get checked out by a doctor and unfortunately had to miss ROE as a result.

I was wondering if there might be any possibility of taking the ROE at a later time? Please let me know if there’s anything I can do or if any arrangements can be made.

If we use ngrok to create a tunnel to our API or Llamafile server, for how long should our terminal remain running? Should it be active only at the time of submission, or must it be continuously available until evaluation is completed?

If yes, is this project just about finding which question is asked and accordingly match the answer send the answer as response?

Hello Sir,

I understand that we can deploy on vercel. Can it be deployed on Heroku as well? I believe both serve the same purpose. Wanted to know your thoughts on the same sir.

Thanks and Regards

Any question from first 5 Ga’s can be there and you would need to analyze which question it is, you can use function calling or prompting as well. Function calling is better approach here.

Hi [@24f2006531](/u/24f2006531)

You can deploy it anywhere, just test how it works on Heroku, if it works(send request to api endpoint to your application and it should respond with answer)

There are a total of 57 questions in all 5 GAs(18+10+9+10+10).  
Due to so many different formats of accepting questions and solving them, my main question is:  
Is the main essence of this project related to deciphering cryptic js code in order to scrape it?

Some other doubts are

1. Some questions ask for you to access some hidden divs in the html page and use that for solving (like week 1 q11)
2. Some questions ask you for AIPROXY TOKENs (like week 3 q9)
3. Some questions required manual correction to get correct answers (like week 4 q2)
4. Some questions require file output (like week 2 q2)

How do we account for this? [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

I have few questions just going through the Project 2 problem statement.

1. Are we supposed to use OpenAI api’s or locally/private hosted one?
2. Many of the questions need files or images or audio files as input, same api is expected to handle those also?
3. Can we work in a team and submit the project together?
4. If we are to use locally hosted llm system, our systems are not strong enough to run most of the good ones locally
5. Is it possible to get a TA to collaborate in our project as an observer?

awaiting a response.

Thank you…

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  
Dear Sir,  
I have few questions. It is written in the [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/project-2) that we can expose the api using vercel (the example given also uses vercel). But I don’t think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below.

1. In GA 1 ques 13 and GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLI `gh` which we have to install in the vercel instance using `apt` package manager.  
   But, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages.
2. In GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that?  
   Also after that, we have to give answer as the ngrok public url for which we have to first install `ngrok` package.
3. In GA 2 ques 8, uploading an image to Dockerhub requires `docker` package installed.
4. In GA 2 ques 6, Deploy a Python API to Vercel in a Vercel instance?
5. Many ques require writing and running FastAPI server to serve data with CORS enabled. Can Vercel allow/do that?
6. And many more

Most tasks mentioned above like installing packages etc. requires sudo privilages or may face restrictions set by Vercel.  
Vercel does not provide sudo access or any form of root access to its hosting environment which is required to perform the above tasks.

Many of these task can be done in our local systems (exposing to internet using cloudflare tunnels/ngrok), but we cannot run our systems 24\*7 during evaluation.

I can see only one option left that is renting a VPS from server providers like digitalocean, gcp, aws etc, which will provide us sudo access and 100% uptime.

Also, some ques requires external toolings like

1. In GA1 ques 5, it is written to explicitly use Excel and this will only work in Office 365.
2. In GA1 ques 6, we have to use Devtools to show/find the hidden element in the question. Now, the question parameter in the POST request will be plain text, so how the element can hide there?
3. GA 2 ques 4 and GA 2 ques 5 uses Google Colab specific python libraries like google.colab which can’t be installed locally.

How to solve these above questions that require explicit usage of external tools.

Also, handling POST request for some questions are not clear like

1. In GA 2 ques 2, we have to compress the image and upload the image as answer. So, now how to response such answer in json object. Should we encode the resultant compressed image as base64 string or Image URL or Data URI.
2. Some ques have images in them. For those images in GAs, I right clicked and used “Save as” to save the images and then done the required computations. So, now when this question will be sent as POST request, will the image be included as the base64 encoded string in the question parameter of the POST request itself or as an optional file attachment?

Another concern is regarding the OpenAI API TOKEN, unlike Project 1, Project 2 does not have an API\_TOKEN parameter in the POST request. Hence, the API TOKEN provided from <https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev> will be also used during evaluation. Now, what will happen if our API TOKEN credits gets end during evaluation. The LLM will throw errors then.

Please advise what we should do. please clarify Sir.

If you are talking about the parameters of those questions, then it would be better if you make your API capable of working with different parameters.

Well if your API is capable of solving those questions in your GAs with the expected answer, then that’s sufficient validation.

If you are indicating towards working collaboratively then,  
Yes, we encourage you to collaborate with others and collectively work towards solving this project. Even if you are going for the relatively easiest approach of Function Calling, it would require you to code about 50 functions to solve all your tasks. Which is why it is sensible to work collectively.

Hello Sir,

I have a few questions. Would like your thoughts and suggestions over the same.

1. Currently answers that we have entered for GA’s 1 to 4 are not available and only for GA5 its available. It would be helpful for the project (when running the Curl command for each of the question) if the assignments can display the answers we’ve entered as well for verification purposes.
2. The first question of GA1 q1 needs for us to run vs code but when executing it through vercel its not possible because vercel is a serverless environment. In this case, is it okay to manually enter the answer in the code, so when the question is triggered it takes the manual output from the code.
3. Can you provide some clarity as to how the question is supposed to be and structured ? Or should the code be able to handle multiple variants of the question? To address this concern, i tried to implement sentence\_transformers using a lightweight model but the vercel application build failed saying that the data is too long and that Vercel serverless function deployment size exceeds the limit of 250 MB. Should i consider deploying elsewhere or change the approach?
4. How do we handle questions pertaining to Devtools - creating input box etc.

Thanks and Regards  
Shalini

What does it mean to solve the question?  
Everyone is asking that?  
Do you yourself know what to do and to go about it?  
Or just pull out something from your hAtSS at the last moment?

“and responds with the answer to enter in the assignment.”  
From my understanding only those questions that are solved with a program and give an answer are to be considered… For example it states in the project that ![:backhand_index_pointing_down:t3:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/backhand_index_pointing_down/3.png?v=13 ":backhand_index_pointing_down:t3:")  
" The response must be a JSON object with a single text (string) field: `answer` that can be directly entered in the assignment. For example:"  
If you all still have not responded, then I’m honestly not sure if this is what y’all meant.  
Last project was not clear to some extent, This time its even more vague.

I understand that y’all want to give different projects to help High Order Thinking skills, but if not executed properly, no one actually learns anything and we(I) just end by debugging the project statement code and question with no relevance to the project. If we wanted to do that, I could just go random GitHub repos and solve and create pull requests for a specific bug. Also we end up losing interest thinking most if the course instructors don’t what they are doing. I understand Anand Sir is extremely busy(like really busy lol), but what are the course instructors doing?

I just want to know if you prefer using an existing language model application where we utilize an LLM (Large Language Model), train it, and format the output. For instance, I used the Gemini API key, integrated it with Python, and then formatted the results with the help of Copilot to achieve the desired outputs.

Alternatively, do you want us to create a new LLM model and train it with questions from graded assignments? I’m curious about your preference.

Additionally, would you like the LLM to provide specific answers regarding computer specifications, or should it give general specifications? For example, in Graded Assignment 1, there is a question about the editor: Visual Studio Code.

Your editor is the most important tool in your arsenal; that’s where you’ll spend most of your time, so make sure you’re comfortable with it.

Visual Studio Code is, by far, the most popular code editor today. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey, almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you’ll likely work with others who use VS Code, so having some exposure is beneficial.

To get started, you can watch these introductory videos (totaling 35 minutes) from the Visual Studio Docs:

* Getting Started: Set up and learn the basics of Visual Studio Code (7 min)
* Code Editing: Learn how to edit and run code in VS Code (3 min)
* Productivity Tips: Become a VS Code power user with these productivity tips (4 min)
* Personalize: Personalize VS Code to make it yours with themes (2 min)
* Extensions: Add features, themes, and more to VS Code with extensions (4 min)
* Debugging: Get started with debugging in VS Code (6 min)
* Version Control: Learn how to use Git version control in VS Code (3 min)
* Customize: Learn how to customize your settings and keyboard shortcuts in VS Code (6 min)

## AI Editors: Copilot, Cursor

Note: AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot use LLMs to help you write code faster. These tools are built on top of VS Code and have become standard in every developer’s toolkit. Please make sure to use them.

To install and run Visual Studio Code, open your Terminal (or Command Prompt) and type `code -s`, then press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below.

What is the output of `code -s`? The output of `code -s` cannot be universally answered because it depends on the user’s system and the specific version of VS Code installed. The question requests the output of a command that is unique to each user.

As for the part about getting answers from the LLM model, I believe that may require using an AI agent. I am currently searching for a solution for this, and I would like to know your thoughts on it.

Sir, for GA-5 question number 3 the file is too large to send via request to vercel  
possible solution is uploading on google drive or smth like that but how will u guys send such long files plus the project only mention sending files not url …Kindly clarify regarding this.

Here, the questions entered after the endpoint will be exactly same as the GAs or be similar as the GAs ??

My Approach , is to

1. scrape and parse all the current question
2. create embeddings , of the questions.
3. create a test endpoint , just to check if i am able to correctly identify the questions
4. segregate numerical , string and json responses and see if these can be answered part of phase 1
5. Phase 2 , experiment with url based answers. need to see if an MCP server can come in handy  
   to deploy a server and return an url

Since the token is limited, I have thought to use the run llms locally, to check for the accuracy of solving the question.

1. I want to know which LLM will be more closer to the one used for evaluating our project.
2. Does the model used for evaluation is capable for handling raw files, or we need to pass it in the text format..(As as I am to recall, the models are capable enough to handle the files..)  
   Thanks!

Does anyone willing to work with me..?

Should we answer the questions and return the response to enter in the answer box(as stated in the question) or should we just provide instructions on how to go about solving the question? Some of the questions include pictures and we cannot use LLM for pictures.

The key learning objective for Project 2 is for you to be absolutely comfortable interacting with APIs and understanding how they work to perform tasks.

So there is very little need for the use of LLMs or agents.

1. Identify the the question being asked (how you do this is upto you, you can be as simplistic as using regex to look for some key words, or you can be clever and create embeddings out of the original question and calculate the similarity from the request)
2. Create a function that solves the question with the required parameters and inputs. Remember this does not have to be fancy. Just compute the answer. You do not need to do the task as the GA required. You ONLY want the answer. No tools required. Just a computed answer.
3. Give the answer back as specified.

Kind regards

Does this mean this type of question won’t be paramaterized?

Like instead of `code -s` there won’t be any other command, otherwise it would require installation of VS Code inside a container to find the answer or this type of questions won’t be part of evaluation at all?

The same confusion is for these type of questions as well:

there will not be any other command. This question can be solved with a hardcoded answer

Excel and Google sheet questions can be solved by just using python . No excel or google sheets required.

The question WILL be parameterised however. So the numbers might be different. You should just understand what the question is asking and solve it programatically to get the answer.

I am not sure how you came to that conclusion!

For example vercel question still requires a vercel endpoint that will respond.

What I said is some questions might not need you to use those specific tools. Your answers should still be legitimate answers that one can paste into the text box of a GA and still get it correct.

The only question that will not be asked is the LLM say yes question.

A github account would still need you to commit a file to it and provide the url that is reachable.

etc.

Hi TAs,

I attended the meet which happened today. But I don’t clearly get one thing.

Most of the questions have a **question text** and a **file: csv,zip,json,etc**

My doubt is, will the request to the end point be :

```
curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=question text" \
  -F "file=https://stats.espncricinfo.com/stats/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;template=results;type=batting"

```

> my doubt :

Hi [@23f2000573](/u/23f2000573)

Yes this is correct format for the question, It will have 2 fields question and file.

You can send a file from local machine like this `-F "file=@abcd.zip"` so here `abcd.zip` must be in current working directory.

Fine sir, this is clear. I have a few doubts in the file formats. When free, kindly address these to. I will try to cover most common doubts, so that you wouldn’t need to answer similar doubts again. Sorry if some of the doubts are basic / written incorrectly.

## FILES

The data file sent to the api will always be in the **requester’s** local machine. When the api server receives the request, the file will be in binary format?

Or

Sometimes the api server receives the file in byte and some times, it will recieve a link like this : <https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png>

This link was take from GA2 Question 2

## HTML AND TABLE

Some questions have `html` and `tables`. In this case will these two be in a file encoded in binary, or will it be a string.

Example for string. Consider the table

| Col 1 | Col 2 |
| --- | --- |
| Row 1, Col1 | Row 1 Col 2 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2 Col 2 |

Will this be something like this

```
"|Col 1| Col 2|\n|-|-|\n|Row 1, Col1 | Row 1 Col 2|\n|Row 2, Col 1|Row 2 Col 2|"

```

or something like

```
"<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Col 1</th>\n<th>Col 2</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 1, Col1</td>\n<td>Row 1 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 2, Col 1</td>\n<td>Row 2 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>
"

```

## HIDDEN BLOCK AND ANSWER : 2 TASKS

In one question, there were two tasks.

* Find the answer to the question
* Enable the `disabled` text block

In this question, what will the answer type be?

Should it just be the answer or should it be the html string which will have the disabled block enabled and also the answer string sitting inside the block

## MORE THAN ONE FILE

Some questions have more than one file. For example, the last question of GA5, it has a png file in this link <https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/jigsaw.webp> and a table.

In this case, how will the curl request be? Is it some thing like this

```
curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=question text" \
  -F "file= Image file" \
  -F "file= table file/ string" 

```

## CORS HEADERS

Will the CORS headers asked in the question be the same or can it be different?

Hi,  
In GA 2, q5, this is the code i got in the question.

```
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
from google.colab import files
import colorsys

# There is a mistake in the line below. Fix it
image = Image.open(list(files.upload().keys)[0])

rgb = np.array(image) / 255.0
lightness = np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: colorsys.rgb_to_hls(*x)[1], 2, rgb)
light_pixels = np.sum(lightness > 0.554)
print(f'Number of pixels with lightness > 0.554: {light_pixels}')

```

Is this the code for others as well?  
Thanks

So I was thinking to create the project 2 together and I was looking for collaboration, and for that we would require the following:

→ the set of question-answers pairs at first  
→ All the questions of 2 distinct students to see which parameters changes in each questions  
→ Make the solution functional and parameterised based on previous step.

Till now I have created the following:

→ Identification of the question, using embeddings  
→ extraction of parameters using llm for that particular question  
→ Implementation of 3 questions using this approach

If we come together, we all can reduce the workload and complete it on time.

\*Those who resonate with my approach or have any different approach feel free to leave a DM. I might not respond immediately as I might not be online all the time ![:slight_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/slight_smile.png?v=14 ":slight_smile:")

file format will be exactly same as corresponding GA.

This is correct html table format.

In last question of GA5 there is only one file(image), table is not coming through file, it will be kept same for project2.

Sir, a few things are not yet clear .

![](https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/j/b9bd4f/48.png) Jivraj:
> file format will be exactly same as corresponding GA.

Some questions have **clickable html buttons**. When we click that, the zipfile or json file, or csv gets downloaded

Some questions have **image attached to the text**. For this, we have to use **right click → download the image**. Here, the image is take from some url. For example. in GA2, q2, the image displayed is taken from <https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png>.

My doubt is, what will be the value of file attribute in curl command

Will it be

* “file=binary of zipfile/csv/json” for the first type and
* “file=<https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png>” for the second type

![](https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/j/b9bd4f/48.png) Jivraj:
> This is correct html table format.

Will this table be in the “question” attribute of curl or “file” attribute

> In last question of GA5 there is only one file(image), table is not coming through file, it will be kept same for project2.

so, can I assume that the table will be given as a html element in the “question” attribute and the image in the “file” attribute?

Files will be exactly same as GA assignment, if there is url then it will be a url and if it get’s downloaded by clicking then it will come from requester’s machine.

For questions that have table they will either come as html code or as markdown. Keep a if else condition for identifying which case it is, if it’s a html then beautiful soup should be able to find table tag, if it’s markdown table then it can be identified with `|` characters.

The portal accept answers in strict json with double quotes. Now in the project we need to return the answer in string value which again has double quotes, so the best answer I could get is using `\"` inside the answer like this.

![Screenshot 2025-03-21 at 4.25.02 PM](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/1/e/1e4550c6e2637e7cf226d943eb61ccb0a8f96770.png)

But still the GA portal marks it as invalid json. What to do in this case?

The correct answer has to be with the escape sequence otherwise you cannot send a valid response back.  
We never feed your response to the GA by copy pasting.

So the questions expecting JSON will be jsonified separately before passing to the evaluator because in the current implementation in the text field idk why it is failing to load the json with `\"` however I could load the exact thing using json.loads in python.

For questions like this (there’s a similar one in GA1 too, will the user send the USER and REPO of their GitHub account as parameters too?  
Even if they do, my script may not get necessary authentication to create repo and make commit in their repository. In this case, would I have to implement GitHub OAuth flow?  
If they don’t send those details but just the email and I am expected to just change the email in my own repo and commit, in the worst case making the same change repeatedly may be misconstrued as a DDoS attack by an automated script which may lead to my GitHub account being suspended, which does not seem ideal.  
Can you please at least hint at a solution?

Edit: Same query for the GitHub actions question (GA2 Q7)

Another edit: A similar query for GA2 Q8. Repeated dockerimage pushes to Dockerhub with different tags.

Use the following script to enable answer boxes and check answers buttons:

```
inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')
textboxes = document.querySelectorAll("textarea")
buttons  = document.querySelectorAll("button")
inputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
buttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));

You won’t be required to update someone else’s repo.  
Any github name, repo name is fine.  
Just that it should have github pages with that particular email address.

In evaluation we will only send request one worst case twice or thrice if it fails from our end, so no issues with that.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) and [@jivraj](/u/jivraj),

Hello.. I am facing issue with zip file extraction function which is in many GA1 questions. e.g., for GA1 Q15, if I use 7-zip to extract files, it shows the correct total size when using Postman for local server. If I use python built-in function, it calculates a different value (which is incorrect). So, I used 7-zip. But I (with help from copilot agent) am not able to make 7-zip work on the vercel deployment. Can we just hard code the answers to GA1 questions, or is there a way to take answer from local server and use it for response in vercel (sorry, it doesn’t even make sense to me, but a lot of things are hard to understand anyway)? Or how do we resolve this 7-zip issue. Python built-in extraction did not work correctly even after hours of trying..

I have another question. Due to lack of time, if I just submit the Project 2, with question/answers to GA1, (and if these all work as expected on vercel), how much approx score can we get if I am not able to do other GAs at all for Project 2. Edit after posting: I can hard code questions and other answers from GA2 upto GA4 (I missed GA5, so don’t have those answers). Thank you.

I too want to know like by 5 questions at random, is it 1 random question per GA or 5 random questions from the entire 5 GAs?

In the later case, there would be no certainty unless all of our questions works and there aren’t any unexpected surprises at the evaluation.

I faced the same issue. Initially, I used `geopy.geocoders` to solve the question, and it provided the correct answer during the assignment submission. However, the same approach is now giving an incorrect result.

Instead of using `geopy`, try using this URL directly: <https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search> .  
This worked for me.

1. I have a doubt like when I pass answers in string and in the questions about markdown will the \n characters be properly parsed before checking the correctness of the markdown or will it be directly checked for valid markdown? Because the raw string when pasted in the text box of the GA isn’t getting the markdown.
2. In case of image compression question, should I return the base64 encoding of the compressed image?

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  
**Respected TDS Team,**

I currently have Three doubts regarding **Project 2**:

1. As per the 19th March session, it was mentioned that the files would be the same for everyone, and only the parameters in the questions would vary. However, I have noticed that the files can actually be different. To support this, I’m attaching screenshots of the CSV files for GA5 Q1—one is mine, and the other belongs to a batchmate.  
   [![mydata](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/d/bd0793de2034d6990e337f71cda4447d55e863bb.png)mydata939×401 18.3 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/d/bd0793de2034d6990e337f71cda4447d55e863bb.png "mydata")  
   [![friend data](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/1/c/1c9058197b1b9e480dec30b06a4e9cca190a1a9e.png)friend data938×465 20.5 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/1/c/1c9058197b1b9e480dec30b06a4e9cca190a1a9e.png "friend data")  
   During the session, it was said that uploading files would take time, and the suggested solution was to pre-download the files on the server since they are supposed to be the same. But since the files are not identical for all students, this issue needs to be addressed.
2. In **GA4 Q2**, my task is to retrieve movie information from IMDb for all films with a rating between 3 and 5. I am scraping the correct movie names(for example 6th movie in given image), but the portal is accepting them differently. All movie names are provided in English, but the portal seems to be accepting some titles in other languages—Spanish, Dutch, I believe.  
   [![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/c/5/c5552e1d6f050b500b4947ddd67164847d970233_2_517x129.png)image1674×420 24.3 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/5/c5552e1d6f050b500b4947ddd67164847d970233.png "image")

   Please check the issue in the images provided. How to handle this question.
3. In **GA4 Q10**, very few students were able to solve the question using LLMs or Python during the assignment. Most of us ended up solving it manually. At that time, [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir had mentioned that the question would be revised.  
   Here is the [thread link](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga4-data-sourcing-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/165959/106) for reference.  
   How should we handle this question now?

Thankyou

Hi [@23f2003751](/u/23f2003751)

### Short Answer: No

### Long Answer:

Backslashes are usually not a problem when converting a string to JSON. But somehow the evaluation script isn’t taking this into consideration. Check this out.  
This is my response  
[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/2/c/2ce94f6194ed92d7a97deab5905560168e9efc33.png)image1113×125 3.01 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/2/c/2ce94f6194ed92d7a97deab5905560168e9efc33.png "image")

which is shown incorrect just after adding 2 backslashes

## [imageimage1107×122 4.01 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/d/cdf8c41b7c8b7001a3a4b48a1c77d8cfdfc0f6d0.png "image")

### Note: It would be better to check your responses on the TDS portal before finalising the script. You can access the answer box and check button by removing the disable attribute.

[@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

it can’t be fixed actually, you would need the answer in the json format

`{"answer": "actual_answer"}`

but if the actual\_answer needs to be string and if it happens to be of json type, it has to be represented using `\"`

The file is just 341kb. it should take less than a second. So you do not have to pre download this file. Only very large ones that are not parameterised you can have a hard copy of.

Questions that require manual intervention will be graded very liberally. In other words those questions will not have as strict a grading criteria as in the GA portal.

# Questions Requiring Clarification/Manual Intervention for Evaluation (As Discussed in Tuesday’s Session)

Respected TDS Team,

As per the discussion during the Tuesday session, and following [@Saransh](/u/saransh)’s suggestion, I am creating this post to list the questions that may require manual intervention or are facing issues potentially due to portal-side behavior. Kindly verify these points before evaluation.

---

## :red_exclamation_mark: Questions Requiring Manual Intervention / Portal-Side Issue

1. GA3 Q8

   * Issue: The question doesn’t mention all required queries. Although all mentioned queries were added, the portal seems to check for additional queries not stated, resulting in an incorrect answer flag.
2. GA3 Q9

   * Issue: This question asks to create an LLM prompt, but upon submission, a pop-up requests the AIPROXY\_TOKEN.
   * Clarification needed: How are we supposed to handle token-based inputs for evaluation?
3. GA4 Q2 & Q10

   * Issue: Previously encountered issues have been resolved.
   * Reference: [GA4 Q2 and Q10 resolution](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/98)
4. Output Formatting (Multiple Questions)

   * Issue: When using plain text, the answer is accepted. However, in JSON format, newline characters (\n) and backslashes are added.
   * Note: As per the project requirement, the output should be in JSON like {“answer”: “result”}. But directly copy-pasting such a result with special characters leads to rejection by the portal.
5. Vercel / Docker Hub / Ngrok Deployment Questions

   * Issue: Some deployment-related questions require a \*\*live-running server, which needs real-time manual deployment using platforms like Vercel or Ngrok.
   * Clarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated?

---

## Deployment-Related Issues (To Be Included in Thursday’s Session)

Please include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues:

1. Platform Capability for GA Tasks

   * Which cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably?
   * Note: Some platforms have limitations that block certain tasks or token usage.
2. File Upload Example via Platform API

   * Request: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app.
   * This would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input.
3. General Observations on GA1-5  
   Output Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine. However, about 20% either have portal-side issues or deployment-related problems.

---

Kindly review these points before final evaluation, and let us know if any additional clarification is required from our side.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) ( [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) ) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) , is it possible to extend the deadline by 2 days April 1st, since we can use the LLM api a little more and Most people(me atleast) have Their OPPEs and its combined syllabus (and the OPPE 1 did not go well, partly due to my inadequacies) , which has much more to cover, since this project involves more involved coding compared to the last project(ideally project one should have taken not more than a day , still messed it up though xD). Asking for extension for 2 days, if possible. Really need it not even want, like **need**

**Summary: Please extend Project 2 deadline by 2 days(April 1st),**  
*(actually 1 day extension is April 1st)*

Hi [@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382) ,  
Unfortunately it’s not possible for us to extend the deadline. Project 2 was released almost a month back, and that can be considered ample amount of time to complete the project. I can understand it must be hard to deal with it along with an upcoming OPPE, but this is what it is. Even if you are not able to cover all the 58 questions, try to cover the majority of them, as the evaluation involves sending just 1-3 questions for evals.

All the best for your OPPE and your Project 2 ![:victory_hand:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/victory_hand.png?v=14 ":victory_hand:")

Yes you are absolutely right. I confirmed this with Carlton and Anand sir, and yes you have to send the JSON responses as strings, which will automatically add those backslashes(\). I apologies for causing this confusion, and I hope I was able to clarify it.

Hi [@21f3001993](/u/21f3001993)  
You can use the `zipfile` library to extract and access zip files pretty easily. You can even make it so that you don’t even have to download the sent file either zip/csv/etc, in order to access it. All this will be discussed in Thurday’s [27-03-2025] Live Session. Kindly attend the session if you want a deeper understanding of it.

```
{
 "answer": "[{\"name\":\"Charlie\",\"age\":16},{\"name\":\"Liam\",\"age\":23},{\"name\":\"Bob\",\"age\":28},{\"name\":\"Grace\",\"age\":36},{\"name\":\"Ivy\",\"age\":44},{\"name\":\"Jack\",\"age\":53},{\"name\":\"David\",\"age\":56},{\"name\":\"Oscar\",\"age\":57},{\"name\":\"Karen\",\"age\":65},{\"name\":\"Frank\",\"age\":67},{\"name\":\"Nora\",\"age\":68},{\"name\":\"Emma\",\"age\":70},{\"name\":\"Paul\",\"age\":88},{\"name\":\"Alice\",\"age\":92},{\"name\":\"Henry\",\"age\":94},{\"name\":\"Mary\",\"age\":97}]"

Your markdown must have newline characters or spaces wherever necessary. Otherwise we will not be able to check if your answer is correct. Our parser will only work if encodings for the formatting are present in the response. If there are no encodings (invisible or visible) then we will not have the correctly formatted file.

Please review module 1 for a better understanding about how text is encoded. Especially invisible characters.

The browser is designed for user friendliness. Thats why the characters are invisible when you copy paste string with newlines. But it exists.

The programmatic strings show invisible encodings as escaped characters. (Usually)

To check if a string has invisible characters,

```
# Multi-line string
my_string = """Hello
World    with    spaces 
and some newlines
and a tab	"""

# Print ASCII values of each character
print([ord(c) for c in my_string])

```

e.g., newline = 10, tab = 9

This is a great way to check what we are receiving when you send us some response,

```
import requests
import json

# This is just an example server to see what we see.

url = "https://httpbin.org/post"

my_multiline_string_answer = """This is a multiline
string that spans
multiple lines    with    spaces 
and some newlines
and a tab	as well."""

response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = {
"answer": my_multiline_string_answer
}

# Send the JSON data
response = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator)

# Check the response
print (response.status_code)
print (response.json ())
print (response.text)

# Do other checks as necessary... 

```

See what happens when I print the result

```
print (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer'])

```

Its a proper multiline correctly formatted text! The encodings are invisible just like in the original as well as in your clipboard when you copy paste into the GA.

Here is a json example:

```
json_answer = {
    "mary": "poppins",
    "age": 42
}

stringed_json = json.dumps (json_answer)
response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = {
"answer": stringed_json
}

response = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator)

print (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer'])

```

Look at the response. A perfect json.  
![Screenshot 2025-03-27 at 3.30.17 pm](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/f/df98b9abfbf5f7d32de578c727f25b166a564560.png)

If you do not want spaces in the response then strip the spaces before you send the stringified response.

Kind regards

I would request the TDS team to please consider making the evaluation criteria for project 2 a bit more liberal.  
5 random Questions with 4 marks each is quite harsh. I request you to make it more balanced like 2 Qs from each GA with 2 marks each or so. So that even if we can’t exhaustively cover the whole number of questions, it gives mercy for the partial completion.

5 random question is a kind of lottery or luck based unless our app is perfect. Thanks

[@carlton](/u/carlton) , [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

1. **GA2 - Question 3: Publish a Page Using GitHub Pages**

* As part of the requirement, I successfully published a webpage using GitHub Pages that includes my email address `21f3001076@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` in the HTML content. The page functions correctly and becomes accessible on my local system.
* To automate the publishing process, I implemented a delay function that checks for the page’s availability after 5 seconds. Based on testing, GitHub Pages typically take around 10–20 seconds to go live after repository creation and HTML deployment. As a result, the complete process—from initiating the API call to verifying that the page is live—takes approximately 30 seconds locally. This setup works reliably on my local machine.
* However, when deploying the same process on Azure, I encountered an issue. Without the delay, the API responds too quickly—before the GitHub Pages site is actually live—resulting in a broken or non-functional link on the assignment portal. On the other hand, including the delay function causes Azure to throw a **502 Bad Gateway** error, likely due to Azure’s request timeout limitations. The additional wait time slightly exceeds the platform’s allowed response duration.

2. **GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files**

* A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a **502 Bad Gateway** error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure’s execution time limit.
* Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.

Currently, I am using Azure for deployment, and for the majority of tasks, it works reliably. Although these specific tasks face timeout issues, shifting to another deployment platform is not feasible at this point. I am not certain if alternative platforms will work consistently across all questions, and making such a change could introduce failures in other parts of the assignment where Azure performs well.

Below Image is showing response of local machine api request for GA2 Q3 which works fine.

### **Final Thoughts on Project 2**

Project 2 has been a valuable yet challenging experience. I’d like to share a few reflections—not as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations.

1. **Organization & Structure:**  
   The project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I’m not blaming anyone—just sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback.
2. **Deployment & Portal Limitations:**  
   There are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning.
3. **Time Constraints:**  
   Balancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments.
4. **Sessions & Support:**  
   The sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward.
5. **Deployment Variability:**  
   Each GA’s questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably.
6. **Effort Acknowledgment:**  
   I sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors—it’s clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it’s also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail—even the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment.
7. **Feasibility in the Given Timeline:**  
   Even for someone with a technical background, it’s difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn’t always feasible before the deadline.

---

I genuinely hope someone is able to complete **all 57 questions** successfully—I’d love to learn from their experience and solutions.

Again, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit. If anything I said seems inappropriate or off the mark, please let me know—I’m happy to edit or delete the post if needed.

**Thank you for the learning opportunity**

Dear Sirs,

I have a question regarding Q3 and Q4 of GA5. When calling the API, should we pass the `.gz` file directly, or will the API accept a Google Drive link from which it can download the `.gz` file?

Specifically, will the API call be structured as follows?

Essentialy, will the API call look like so?

> curl -X POST “<http://127.0.0.1:5000>”   
> -H “Content-Type: multipart/form-data”   
> -F "question=Bandwidth Analysis for Regional Contents - [anand.net](http://anand.net) is a personal website that had region-specific music content. One of the site’s key sections is tamilmp3, which hosts music files and is especially popular among the local audience. The website is powered by robust Apache web servers that record detailed access logs. These logs are essential for understanding user behavior, server load, and content engagement. By analyzing the server’s Apache log file, the author can identify heavy users and take measures to manage bandwidth, improve site performance, or even investigate potential abuse. Your Task: This GZipped Apache log file has 258,074 rows. Each row is an Apache web log entry for the site [s-anand.net](http://s-anand.net) in May 2024. Each row has these fields:
>
> IP: The IP address of the visitor.  
> Remote logname: The remote logname of the visitor. Typically ‘-’.  
> Remote user: The remote user of the visitor. Typically ‘-’.  
> Time: The time of the visit. E.g. [01/May/2024:00:00:00 +0000]. Note that this is not quoted, and you need to handle this.  
> Request: The request made by the visitor. E.g. GET /blog/ HTTP/1.1. It has three space-separated parts:  
> (a) Method: The HTTP method. E.g. GET.  
> (b) URL: The URL visited. E.g. /blog/.  
> (c) Protocol: The HTTP protocol. E.g. HTTP/1.1.  
> Status: The HTTP status code. If 200 <= Status < 300, it is a successful request.  
> Size: The size of the response in bytes. E.g. 1234.  
> Referer: The referer URL. E.g. <https://s-anand.net/>.  
> User agent: The browser used. This will contain spaces and might have escaped quotes.  
> Vhost: The virtual host. E.g. [s-anand.net](http://s-anand.net).  
> Server: The IP address of the server.
>
> The fields are separated by spaces and quoted by double quotes (‘-’). Unlike CSV files, quoted fields are escaped via \" and not ‘-’. (This impacts 41 rows.)

>
> Aggregate Data by IP: Sum the ‘Size’ field for each unique IP address from the filtered entries.
>
> Identify the Top Data Consumer: Determine the IP address that has the highest total downloaded bytes. Report the total number of bytes that this IP address downloaded.

> -F “file=@s-anand.net-May-2024.gz”

I would appreciate your clarification on whether the `.gz` file should be directly included in the API request or if a Google Drive link should be provided instead.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

[@carlton](/u/carlton)  
I watched the last session. In that session, regarding the specific PDF question, you mentioned that the PDF is the same for everyone, so it can be preprocessed beforehand. However, I checked and found that the PDF is actually different for each user. So, we need to fetch it from the API endpoint.  
How should we handle the timeout issue on the deployment platform? I even tried upgrading the plan, but it didn’t help.

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand)  
[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Also, many questions and doubts were addressed in the last two sessions. I can improve a lot and add the remaining questions, but the constraint is the 31st March deadline. Most students, including myself, will only get time after 30th March due to Viva and OPPE.  
It would be really helpful if the TDS team could extend the deadline.

I believe it would strike a good balance—team made us wait for the Project 1 results, but extending the Project 2 deadline would make up for that for some extent. Its request nothing else.

[{"name":"Alice","age":67},{"name":"Bob","age":53},{"name":"Charlie","age":34},{"name":"David","age":89},{"name":"Emma","age":92},{"name":"Frank","age":37},{"name":"Grace","age":4},{"name":"Henry","age":49},{"name":"Ivy","age":30},{"name":"Jack","age":2},{"name":"Karen","age":2},{"name":"Liam","age":5},{"name":"Mary","age":32},{"name":"Nora","age":56},{"name":"Oscar","age":19},{"name":"Paul","age":22}]

```

Sorted JSON:

here would question be sent as text only or text + json file seperately?

The `.gz` file would be sent along with the API request. You can even read the file directly without even downloading it.

Hi [@22f3002933](/u/22f3002933)  
Files are less likely to change, but parameters are. For instance, GA1\_Q12, the zip file is less likely to change but the symbols to perform the aggregate on would be changed.

Hi [@lakshaygarg654](/u/lakshaygarg654),  
Yes for GA4\_Q9 the PDF files are different for everyone, but the workflow is exactly the same. Its a basic tabula read, with no particular need of any preprocessing. So, yeah you have to fetch it from the API request.  
Unfortunately, we can’t extend Project 2 deadline, it was released on 3rd of March, and we believe ample amount of time was given for it. If you are lagging far behind in the race, we would encourage you to collaborate with other and get the project done.

Thanks for the answer sir.

I remember being told on the last session, that the question will be exactly the same we have on the assignment portal for my respective case, and the answer on the portal can be the same here as well.

Actually I am exploring a hardcoded answer route where if i return the answer which I already got after solving the questions on the portal (in certain qns with dynamic functions) , so thought of asking if method is alright.

Yes sending your GA answer as text as the JSON response can work if the question was not parameterized. I hope you are aware that parameters for some questions will be changed, resulting in different answers.

Thanks for your reply [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  
I’ve figured out the solution to that particular question.  
The deadline is still a concern, as many issues were only resolved during recent sessions—similar to the project 1 workflow—and This time there are many other things in the pipeline ( viva’s and oppe’s )  
Anyway, I will complete this course with valuable learnings, but many others have been seriously affected by it.

Hi [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@carlton](/u/carlton) ,

In the sample curl command  
i.e.

```
curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=Download and unzip file abcd.zip which has a single extract.csv file inside. What is the value in the "answer" column of the CSV file?" \
  -F "file=@abcd.zip"

```

It is given that only one file arguement is passed , can there be a usecase where multiple files are sent , for example GA-5 10th question Image reconstruction where there could be one file be the image another could be separate file with mapping, Although mapping can be given with question as well,  
But still can you please confirm if there will be only one file or there can be multiple files send to API?

Hello Sir,

I want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to work on this project. I have developed a mini chatbot backend using `vicky_server.py`, which handles question matching and execution internally, producing appropriate responses. `My mini chatbot is capable of creating its own API using REST and can manage tasks such as image compression, repository management, workflows, and web scraping related to graded assignments. It can even calculate total marks for subjects like physics and convert PDFs into markdown content. Additionally, it is capable of downloading the Llama model and creating a tunnel using ngrok. Essentially, it can address the first four assignment questions.`

However, there are some limitations to this project. Currently, it processes my local files instead of the uploaded PDFs. I am working on resolving this issue, but I have some confusion regarding the internal handling of uploaded files. When I pass a PDF or file through an upload method, how should the system proceed? I want to ensure that the file is treated as a PDF for the user rather than just being referenced as “question.pdf.” How can I effectively manage this problem?

Furthermore, there is an issue with question matching. At times, the system incorrectly identifies questions containing the word “code” and executes `first.py` for GA1.

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project!

Best regards,  
vicky kumar

[@carlton](/u/carlton)  
I am bit confused about answer evaluation process. Can you tell which one is correct process.  
1st process ( I used json.dumps() to get my\_response as json formatted string)  
[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/2/b2c5345c348f63fcf52240ba6c07cb8655d7d17c.png)image726×224 4.68 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/2/b2c5345c348f63fcf52240ba6c07cb8655d7d17c.png "image")

2nd process ( This one is Json object)  
[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/8/4/848f46d75a3912b4ccc280a7594136401c0f0c36.png)image514×193 3.61 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/8/4/848f46d75a3912b4ccc280a7594136401c0f0c36.png "image")

or both are incorrect?

This is one more example of 1st process after json.loads() it gave me correct format for assignment portal answer:  
[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/e/ae62c221a5f66faaa47d8b10c00b733a7b617d64.png)image927×466 20.8 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/e/ae62c221a5f66faaa47d8b10c00b733a7b617d64.png "image")

This is one more example of 2nd process without use of json.loads() it gave me correct format for assignment portal answer:  
[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/8/f80d8908109db818e5664f5565bf0a6006055001.png)image984×476 19.7 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/8/f80d8908109db818e5664f5565bf0a6006055001.png "image")

Hi [@lakshaygarg654](/u/lakshaygarg654)  
In both the scenarios you laid out, the second implementation is correct. Your response to our API request should be a JSON object `{"answer" : "YOUR RESPONSE AS STRING"}`. In any case the value of the `"answer"` key should be a string.

This is a basic prototype function we would be using to send requests to your URL.

```
def run(question, file_path):
    url = "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api"
    questions = {'question': question}
    files = [
        ('file', open("abcd.zip", 'rb')),
        ('file', open("dcba.img", 'rb'))
    ]
    response = requests.post(url, data=questions, files=files)
    return response

```

or

```
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=question" \
  -F "file=@abcd.zip" \

I couldn’t find this function on the Project Doc and I made the project based on the curl function calling.

At this moment it can’t be changed as I am occupied with other things. Please keep the question parameter as “question” and file parameter as “file” in the evaluation which is on the Project 2 page and the content type as multipart/form-data.

To clarify if I can handle any one of these 2 methods, I will be fine?

Edit:  
Just now discovered that the field names are indeed “question” and “file” only in both the cases. Sorry for the oversight.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
I have a few queries. Even a yes/no response for each would suffice.

GA1:  
Q13 - Use GitHub: Since the parameter is just my email, this question *WILL NOT* be tested against any other email, right? So I can just have a repo with my email in it, right?

GA2:  
Q2 - Compress an image: Should my app’s response be like this

```
{
     "answer": "base64_encoding_of_compressed_image"
}

```

Q3 - Host your portfolio on GitHub Pages, Q7 - Create a GitHub action, Q8 - Push an Image to Docker Hub: Similar to GA1 Q13, these too have my email or roll number as parameter. These too **WILL NOT** be checked against any other email, right?

GA3:

Can you please give an example of how questions of this GA will be sent in the request, especially any of Q1 or Q2 or Q5 or Q6 or Q7 or Q8 which have code-blocks containing text crucial to the question? I just want to decide whether regex or function-calling would be more appropriate here.

GA4:

The links to the website are hyperlinks in the questions. When the question will be sent to my app, will the link of the website to be scraped be written as a full link in the question itself or will it be sent in some other way?

GA5:

No particular questions at the moment.

Please help me out by answering these asap

As per your reply time, I was in TDS session at that time.  
And asked same doubt, [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) said 1st implementation they will use. ![:sweat_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/sweat_smile.png?v=14 ":sweat_smile:")

What Jivraj agreed was stringifying the answer and putting it in as the value of the `"answer"` key in the JSON object.  
`{ "answer" : "YOUR_STRINGIFIED_ANSWER" }`

Just check the Project 2 page on the portal. It’s clearly mentioned a JSON object has to sent not a strigified version of the entire JSON object.

Response from api should be a string, which if we load using json.loads it should load json object with answer key.

This is correct, make sure you test decoding base64 string before deadline.

Same answer as Q13 GA1

> Can you please give an example of how questions of this GA will be sent in the request, especially any of Q1 or Q2 or Q5 or Q6 or Q7 or Q8 which have code-blocks containing text crucial to the question? I just want to decide whether regex or function-calling would be more appropriate her

We will take Q1 in this format, which is just copy pasting from portal```  
One of the test cases involves sending a sample piece of meaningless text:

```
au7BK3 33 H 5   lKz6y4n  oQmbgoX 0  hNW3JH  68Q1u

```

Write a Python program that uses `httpx` to send a POST request to OpenAI’s API to analyze the sentiment of this (meaningless) text into GOOD, BAD or NEUTRAL. Specifically:

1. Make sure you pass an Authorization header with dummy API key.
2. Use `gpt-4o-mini` as the model.
3. The first message must be a system message asking the LLM to analyze the sentiment of the text. Make sure you mention GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL as the categories.
4. The second message must be **exactly** the text contained above.

This test is crucial for DataSentinel Inc. as it validates both the API integration and the correctness of message formatting in a controlled environment. Once verified, the same mechanism will be used to process genuine customer feedback, ensuring that the sentiment analysis module reliably categorizes data as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. This reliability is essential for maintaining high operational standards and swift response times in real-world applications.

**Note**: This uses a dummy `httpx` library, not the real one. You can only use:

1. `response = httpx.get(url, **kwargs)`
2. `response = httpx.post(url, json=None, **kwargs)`
3. `response.raise_for_status()`
4. `response.json()`

```

As per the portal, we have to return a JSON object as a response from the API. However, if we load a JSON object directly using `json.load()`, it will throw an error. We need to first convert it into a JSON string and then load it using `json.loads( )`. For clarity I add image below.

This question has been stretched for too long—it’s not that big.

I guess [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) is right.

Hello [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) sir.  
We truly appreciate the effort you put into designing and evaluating our graded assignments and projects. We understand that any five random questions will be selected for evaluation, and we fully respect this approach.

However, we kindly request that the same set of five questions be used for all students to ensure a uniform and unbiased evaluation process. This way, the difficulty level remains consistent across all evaluations, providing a fair assessment of our understanding.

Thank you for considering our request. We appreciate your guidance and support.

Best regards,

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) I just wanted to bring to your attention that in GA4 question 2, the answer evaluation script expects the movie title as “17. Kraven: The Hunter” but it is actually listed on the IMDb page as “17. Kraven the Hunter”, resulting in the correct one being marked wrong.  
No questions here just wanted to bring it to attention so that it does not affect the project evaluation script.

Its unusual to have a docker container worth 7 GBs of space. Here is what you can do

* Remove unused libraries from your `requirements.txt`. Sometimes having resource demanding libraries like `SentenceTransformers` can install large sub-dependency packages.
* Exclude your virtual environment folder from the container creation
* Create a `.containerignore` file to have an exception for those folders you want to skip.
* Clear your package cache and any vscode cache you might have.

In the previous replies, you’ve mentioned that for Github questions → actions, pages (GA2) that if the email changes for everyone it means that its parameterised. However, in one of the live sessions this week, Carlton had mentioned that for these questions, it wont be parameterised as this is very individual specific. The same goes for the docker hub question of GA2 as well. KIndly clarify on the same.

For GA2 Q9 → I have given an input file via post request and my fastapi server can handle get requests and its as follows. Kindly confirm if my url is good to go for this specific question.

I am going to clarify this once and for all  
The response should be a **JSON Object** with the value of the `"answer"` key as a string.

```
{ "answer" : "YOUR_ANSWER_AS_STRING" }

```

This is the way we are expecting your responses.  
However, due to the heavy confusion among students and will be considering responses with entire JSON objects stringified. We don’t want anyone to loose their marks for such a miniscule error.  
So,

```
"{\"answer\": \"YOUR_ANSWER\"}"

```

is also valid.

Sir, I have an issue in GA5 Q3

What is the number of successful GET requests for pages under **/telugu/** from **11:00** until before **20:00** on Mondays?

For this, I have used two python scripts to get the answer, one written completely by me and another from someone else’s solution; both give the same answer - **2698**

However, the portal says it’s incorrect. No modifications resulting in different answer are being accepted either and the modifications themselves seem to break the bounds of the question.

Please check the scripts and tell me where I am going wrong.

My script:

```
import subprocess
from datetime import datetime

def isDay(dtobj, day):
  return dtobj.weekday() == day

def isTime(dtobj, l, u):
  return l <= dtobj.hour < u

step1 = subprocess.run("cat data | grep -i 'GET /telugu/'", capture_output=True, shell=True, text=True)
subprocess.run("rm -f forstep2.txt", shell=True)
with open('forstep2.txt', 'a') as f:
  for line in step1.stdout.splitlines():
    try:
      status = int(line.split()[8])
    except Exception as e:
      status = 400

Hi,  
i deployed the application the application in render. It is free for 750 hours per month. But it is saying if the application is inactive mode, it will be go spin-off mode and take some 50 seconds to respond to the first query from inactive mode.  
is that ok?

Respected Sir,

We kindly request a one-day extension for Project 2, as we finished with vivas and OPPE yesterday only. The circumstances this time have been more challenging than in Project 1, making it difficult to meet the deadline.

We would be extremely grateful if you could consider this request. Your support would be highly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Good morning sir,  
Could you please extend the deadline for Project 2 as today(31/03/2025) is the last day of submission and it clashes with “Eid al-Fitr”. I have small portion of work left but it won’t be possible as there is frequent visit of guests and friends. Could you please extend the deadline till 02/04/2025, this will give us enough amount of time to complete the project after our festival.  
Thank you

[@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

What is the request timeout for each question, especially for the question on YouTube video transcription? I request the timeout to be at least 40-60 seconds as yt-dlp and faster-whisper take take to download the audio, load the model and run it on cpu and get the transcription.  
For 259.7 to 351.8 seconds, it is taking around 1.5 mins, but it is giving the correct answer.

So I request you to shorten the length of the audio or increase the request timeout or both in moderation.

Question —> the “question” sent to the api will have the youtube video link, right? Or since the video is same for everyone, can I just have the audio file ready in the project? Will the api be tested against any YouTube video other than the Mystery Story Audiobook link given in the GA question?

Edit: Even with a preprocessed audio file (mp3, speech optimized, 32K), what’s taking the longest time is joining the transcribed sentences into a single string. That alone is taking >50 seconds. Please suggest a way to make it faster.

Regards,  
Shivaditya

For the FastAPI type questions, my endpoints are like <http://ip>:port/endpoint. But while testing using the portal it expects HTTPS instead of http. But nothing of that sort is given in the question. Will the evaluator also expect a https url or is a http url enough for it to hit the endpoint?

Sir, I have created the frontend app like an html page with the fastapi utilizing the chatgpt-o3 , instead of Api key. I managed to get api keys but ended up in only text mining without file handing (not able to do multipart-form data). So, I have made to use the model and designed a frontend which also takes the input from the file uploaded, So, it will be ideal for assignment solver, Isn’t it , Sir?

Hi [@22f3000370](/u/22f3000370)  
We appreciate the efforts you have put in. But, for the project we aren’t expecting a full-stack app with an integrated frontend. We just need an API endpoint on which we would be able to send requests in the given format. For more info check the TDS course page. [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/project-2)

I have deployed the project on render so the first request in evaluation takes around 50 to 60 second is that okay

I deployed my API using Railway.app, but Jio ISP is blocking requests to `.up.railway.app`. I tested it with five other ISPs, and the API endpoint works perfectly. Could you please consider that some ISPs may be blocking certain domains?

We’ll try to keep this in consideration while developing the evaluation script. But to be on the safer side keep sending requests to your server on such intervals that it doesn’t go inactive.

I completely understand the need to keep evaluations on schedule. In that case, would it be possible to grant just a one-day extension? I’ve completed up to Week 3 and just need a little extra time to wrap up Weeks 4 and 5 properly. A single day would really help me submit a more polished project without causing significant delays

If your team was aware of this, I’d like to understand why it was allowed to deploy on ngrok. I typically use Vercel for deployment, but as you know, Vercel doesn’t support certain features.

Respected Sir,

I kindly request a deadline extension of at least 3 minutes for the project submission, similar to what was done for ROE.

PLEASE Sir, As I’m a standalone student and this is my primary degree after 12th, please do accept it.

My project is hosted on render, because vercel refuses to cooperate with me, as a result the free version of render takes a minute to respond, and not only that but might also give internal server error until the 2nd or 3rd try. There is nothing I can do to change this except for maybe sending requests every now and then like it was suggested for another student using render. I just want to know if this is okay for evaluation.

I have a curious question.  
I have my project running from azure and code in GitHub repository.

What is stopping me from making further change to my deployment because my end point will be same. Anyway my code checksum for the deployment and GitHub code won’t match as I haven’t pushed the token to GitHub.

Thanks,

I reuesting to all my teachers [@s.anand](/u/s.anand), [@carlton](/u/carlton), [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj), [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) please reply me.

What is this going on? Is it joking? Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? Are we studying in IIT - The top institute of India or in a cheap and lower than third class government schools. It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. I don’t think so that they really made any effort in our course. In project-2 also, we need solutions for all graded assignments and so many students request for solutions but our the great teachers ignores the request and didn’t provide the solutions. I think they provide the projects whatever comes in their dreams during sleeping. In weekly study material, don’t have their notes, even they have a very few videos made by them, they just render to other YouTuber’s Youtube videos and online websites. Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything.

Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- "We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. ". I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. But on extending the deadline of project-2 just only for one day, their evaluation will be late. In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. It is our tales it is my right to get solutions for every weekly assignment, but don’t ask them to make efforts. Just pay and do assignments at own risk even you have not understand anything from the copy-pasted material. Just use AI’s or read whatever and wherever you want to read.

It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.

Thankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’.

hi,

I dont share your views.

i feel it was one of the best course in whole of Diploma.

I have learned a lot in these projects and even in ROE preparation.

all the things we are learning here are open in market and the course contents are great direction towards learning and practicing them.

I agree it is stessful, my whole team were in a 9-hour g-meet call on Saturday night. but we have found solutions, shared ideas, try-outs, made fun of each other.

but at the end of the day we all agree that we have learnt lots of new things.

Regarding Project1 delay: if we think, atleast 1GB of docker image per students for 700+ students. even if parallalize the execution 5 students at a time you still need a very powerfull system to download and amount of data downloading etc… At the end of the day we got a very good result and report with logs to verify

for GA’s: it is upto you to copy solutions or learn something out of each GA sections

All in all I am happy with the course.

Dear Shahzada,

You joined Discourse almost a year ago Jun 8th, 2023. In all that time you have read 832 posts. And never interacted with anyone on discourse. You finally decided to interact once and that was today and this is your first post (your second if we count that you deleted your first post)

The first step to receiving help is communication. If you do not communicate, no one can help you.

![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:
> What is this going on? Is it joking?

I am not sure what your question is. I am not sure what you are referring to. Please be clear in your questions.

![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:
> Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do?

We have made **several hours of videos** on Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself.

![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:
> I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project.

Not sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared)

![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:
> They explained what should be your approach? How to make project?

Yes these were explained if you

1. either took part in any live session or
2. watched the recorded video

![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:
> And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times?

I am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks.

![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:
> It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off.

Project 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words:  
Create a server api that receives a request.  
The request would be any question from the first 5 GAs.  
The response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page.

Multiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions.

![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:
> Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake?

Since this is your first post, you’ve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process.

If you want solutions, there are several options:

1. Ask for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it)
2. Collaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration)
3. Join live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked)
4. Watch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q & A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment)

![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:
> They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically.

This is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting.

The biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs… with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning.

> Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers.

If you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video.

But feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up.

What are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that.

I absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you.

Reading documentation is a skill you have to pick up. **Having said that, we have always explained something that students have asked.** Just ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world.

Now is a good time to start.

![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:
> Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- "We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. "

That is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic.

![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:
> I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1?

They have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time.

**Luckily for you,** our first priority is always to do our best for students. So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be).

![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:

If you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion.

![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:

Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal.

Anand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution?

Also if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script.

But validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime.

You can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback.

![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:

I am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither `respect` nor `kindness` is evident in your post.

But thank you for your feedback.

One final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score.

And when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve.

Kind regards,  
TDS team

## Post by B R GIRI SUBRAHMANYA - April 02, 2025 12:44:19
**Post ID**: 614585

Hi, I have a few things to say

## My background :

I have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term.

## My Initial Disappointments with this Course

In one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction):

> The video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended.

* Here, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn’t like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph
* ROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful.
* There are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily.

## Why did I fail?

### Last Term

I dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn’t practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon.

## This term.

I made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn’t allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn’t submit both the projects.

In both the terms I didn’t collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn’t earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair.

## Me Understanding about the Course Now

This one line changed my view about ROE.

![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/s.anand/48/15264_2.png)[On another topic](/t/99838/2)
> **What does this RoE evaluate?** Implicit learning.

I am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don’t know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough.

I scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS.

Now I realize that I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time.

In MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing `SKLearn`. Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE.

This course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an ***implicit*** way.

This is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code.

I have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks

I have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc.

I am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt.

From the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn’t do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn’t cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects.

Since this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too.

Thanks to [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) , [@carlton](/u/carlton) , [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) and [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

> Just two suggestions

* I feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites.
* While introducing the projects, kindly include a video where the flow of the project is explained. Also, address few questions in the video itself which are likely to be asked by us.

When are you guys likely to test the API endpoints for Project 2?  
I have hosted it on Microsoft Azure, and I only have $92 left out of the free $100 credit. It would be great if you could do this within a week. It is decreasing rapidly.

Evaluations will start before this weekend, with some sampling done possibly even tonight and most evaluation runs tomorrow.

Also we will prime the target first by sending a dummy request so it gets “warmed up” because some of you have reported time to respond to first request takes time for the server to spin up.  
Then once we know its responding, we will send requests for evaluation.

Kind regards

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir, I have noticed that sometimes our vm based application gets stuck and on verifying every request using FastApi have noticed that best way to check is run and get your answer post that RESET it back and then run another query and it works perfectly fine, not sure have other faced this issue or not, but it would be great if you could take note of this while evaluating just for safety.

Hope you take note of this and take this into consideration.

Okay so basically sometimes what happens is while verifying on FASTApi – it gives errors like missing paramaters like… So basically sometimes it needs resetting the request parser and then it works perfectly fine.

```
{
  "detail": "execute() missing 1 required positional argument: 'file_bytes'"
}

```

Which is incorrect, so if we press the RESET button and execute it works properly.

The way we test your api is **not through a front end.**

We send a request to the endpoint directly. We have demoed it in live sessions.

We have even posted on discourse snippets of what this looks like.

As long as your endpoint responds to a request that we send, it will be fine.

Kind regards

Dear [@Carlton](/u/carlton) and [@S.Anand](/u/s.anand),  
I successfully deployed my project on Vercel, and it works perfectly when tested using curl commands. Each task installs its required packages and runs as expected. However, I encountered an issue with Vercel’s free version, which has a 250MB limit. While my project’s size without installed packages is approximately 34MB, the size exceeds the limit once packages like Pandas, NumPy, Pillow, Whisper, and Uvicorn are installed, causing the server to crash.  
Could you kindly suggest any alternatives or solutions for this issue? I would greatly appreciate your guidance, as I fear all my hard work might go to waste without a resolution.

We are in the processing pipeline. You will have to wait till it completes. Basically if your endpoint works when we send it a request you will be evaluated. We will use the timestamp of your latest endpoint before the deadline.

Hope that answers your question.

The alternative is to use vercel purely as an endpoint service that processes most things without large libraries, and for more heavy duty backend work forwards the request to another system that handles it and sends it back to your vercel function which then relays the answer to the request.

in spreadsheet edit response modify previous response with timestamp, how you can access that timestamp response?? So how can u have my end point before deadline one since i updated it after deadline.  
Also the before deadline one end point is  
/api which i changed to /api/ after deadline so if u somehow have access to my old url pls consider adding 1 (slash) / :')

# :graduation_cap: From Problem to Platform: Building “Vicky” – A Smart Data Science Assistant for TDS @ IIT Madras

![:rocket:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/rocket.png?v=14 ":rocket:") **Project Demo Website**: <https://app.algsoch.tech>

During our college course *Tool for Data Science (TDS)* at **IIT Madras**, we were tasked with a challenging but exciting project: **to build a platform that can take in natural language questions and execute corresponding solutions through an API**.

## :brain: The Mission:

Create a tool that behaves like a **chatbot**, accepts **user queries (text or file-based)** via **web or API**, processes them intelligently, **executes the appropriate code**, and returns accurate results—like a real data science assistant.

---

## :counterclockwise_arrows_button: The Journey: From Fails to Final

At first, the natural choice was to try **LLM agents**—they sounded magical. But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries. ![:cross_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/cross_mark.png?v=14 ":cross_mark:")

Then I thought—what if I manually mapped questions and answers using a **static JSON structure**? That quickly broke when users passed **different parameters, different files**, or queried in **non-standard formats** like “code -s” or “code -v”.

The next idea: write **individual Python scripts per question** from our Graded Assignments (GA1–GA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable. ![:cross_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/cross_mark.png?v=14 ":cross_mark:")

---

## :wrench: The Breakthrough: Dynamic Function Mapping

After multiple iterations and failed prototypes, I finally found the right architecture:

![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") Centralized engine in `vicky_server.py`  
![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") Uses **regex-based pattern matching** to detect question types, extract parameters, and identify the correct solution  
![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") Each solution is a structured Python function like `ga1_first_solution(query=None)`  
![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") Supports dynamic parameter injection, command-line variations, file-based queries, and more  
![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") Acts like a **mini compiler for data science tools**

---

## :globe_with_meridians: Presenting Vicky – The Mini Chatbot for TDS :fire:

Vicky is a **smart, modular chatbot** built specifically for **Tool for Data Science at IIT Madras**. It’s packed with real functionality—not just templates.

### Key Features:

![:brain:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/brain.png?v=14 ":brain:") **Graded Assignment Solver**  
Handles dynamic, real-world questions from GA1 to GA5 like:

* `code -s` / `code -v` → VS terminal commands
* Create FastAPI API for CSV with filtering/searching
* GitHub automation: repo creation, GitHub Actions setup
* Data cleaning, scraping from IMDb, image compression

![:open_file_folder:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/open_file_folder.png?v=14 ":open_file_folder:") **File Upload with Query Matching**  
Users can upload a file (CSV, JSON, Excel) and ask file-specific queries. The system understands context and dynamically links the query to the uploaded file.

![:globe_showing_europe_africa:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/globe_showing_europe_africa.png?v=14 ":globe_showing_europe_africa:") **HTML Viewer + Base64 Decoder**

* View any website in rendered & source format using CORS proxy
* Upload Base64 string → Get original image back

![:robot:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/robot.png?v=14 ":robot:") **Webhooks Integration**

* Live notifications via **Discord** & **Slack** whenever `/api` endpoints are accessed
* Monitors **server status (online/offline)** and sends real-time updates

![:spouting_whale:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/spouting_whale.png?v=14 ":spouting_whale:") **LLM Download + Auto Tunneling**

* Downloads LLaMA models
* Dynamically finds available ports
* Creates and exposes tunneled endpoints

![:chart_increasing:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/chart_increasing.png?v=14 ":chart_increasing:") **Live Web UI at [app.algsoch.tech](https://app.algsoch.tech)**

* Ask any TDS question
* Upload and query with files
* Image decoder
* Graded assignment slider navigation
* HTML viewer
* API health status

---

## :man_technologist: Built With:

* **FastAPI** for blazing fast APIs
* **Regex & Pattern Matching** for dynamic input detection
* **GitHub Copilot** + my Python debugging and architectural thinking
* Full webhook and status monitoring system
* Modular backend (`vicky_server.py`) and web frontend (`vicky_app.py`)

I want to extend a huge thank you to [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) for their guidance on this project. I’ve learned what prompt engineering is and how we can leverage large language models (LLMs). One interesting takeaway is that while these technologies won’t replace our jobs—especially for those who understand programming—they will create new job opportunities instead.  
Now I am capable of how fastapi work and more things and how to structure code and how to design code and most important what to think for project

Dear Sir,  
I would like to clarify the situation regarding my previous submission. Initially, I provided an ngrok link, but due to an error with ngrok, it stopped working. I then found an alternative solution using Cloudflare with a custom domain that I obtained through the GitHub Student Pack. I successfully created a tunnel, and it is currently functional. I can shut down my laptop, and it still works with the same URL when I restart.  
I hope you will consider my case. I submitted my work at that time because I learned about this solution from a fellow student on Discord. I only changed the URL and made no other modifications.  
Thank you for your understanding

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton)

The same issue has affected several of us. During the last Google Meet session, we explained the situation to [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini).

It seems that when we edit our responses, the timestamp with other values updates not submitted as new response. However, the position of the response in the form remains unchanged. For instance, we submitted our response at 11:30 PM on March 31st, and someone else submitted theirs at 11:45 PM. Even after editing our response the next day, our entry still appears above theirs.  
We just wanted to clarify: Will responses edited or submitted on April 1st still be considered, given that the form remains open? If not, is there any way we can show proof of our original submission? Currently, we have email confirmations for both the initial and the edited responses.

We hope this won’t be a major issue, especially not on the level of Project 1 concerns. Looking forward to a positive resolution from the TDS team.

Thank you  
Lakshay

Dear Sir [@carlton](/u/carlton),

Sir, please note that after the deadline I haven’t resubmitted the form but I have edited it (as the form was allowing editing till then). Now what exactly have I edited is just added a “/” at the end and that’s it and nothing more. Highlighting it again, I haven’t resubmitted the form but edited it on the very next morning after the deadline.

So now my question is: My edited response will be accepted right in this case?  
Sir, please throw some light on my doubt.

Also a better evaluation strat would be to submit the GitHub repo in the form(Else they can make changes to the repo, who checks the commit history?) and maybe conduct a 2 min demo where the student clones the repo and then you run the script?  
I know many students are there but other subjects do it for project courses?

Maybe a helpful tip for next time

If i do fail and repeat this course. Hopefully not XD

I started it once again. Can you please reevaluate it now if it hasn’t been done yet. I actually tested it till 3rd of April and it was working fine. I don’t know what actually happened. Please do consider.

Actually in the free tier there are many issues. These issues are beyond our control and I request the TDS team to please consider this issue and please consider re-evaluating it if it has not been done yet as we had put in a lot of efforts.

The same thing has happened to me as the mentioned above. I also have not received request from Indian IP as far as I can see on the logs. I am using the azure VM itself.  
I rechecked and maybe the server went offline, so I re-ran the script anyway and checked a few questions now and it works.  
I think after a certain while it timed out for me(not entirely sure tho)… but i fixed it.

Create a shell script that loops through the list of API endpoints and uses `curl` to send requests to each. You can pass headers, authentication tokens, or data as needed.

Hi sir, just wanted to know when will the results be released. And also in the image I attached it I think shows five different scores for each questions you asked through curl. Is that the mark for each questions and total mark should be considered?

also want to know if we need to do any extra projects for the bonus marks.

Hello,

I wanted to provide an update regarding the issue I faced while I was in Jammu. During my stay, my laptop was on, but I encountered an error that caused my endpoint to crash. It seemed that Cloudflared mentioned needing an update, which I believe contributed to the problem.

Now that I’m back in Delhi, I’m connected to the internet, and I’m happy to report that my endpoint is working again.

see this image I have designed my endpoint to monitor with discord webhook

[@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  
Sir, I saw from the logs on Cloud Run that my project was probably evaluated on 5th April at around 11:51 PM and all the requests made during that time resulted in 3 response status codes: 302, 307 and 405 by no fault of my app, but rather errors in the request itself. I mentioned the exactly correct URL of my app in the form but the evaluation logs show three different types of URL to which request was made. As I mentioned in the form, my url is of the format “https://…/api/” and allows only POST requests.

1. The app was supposed to allow POST requests and I allowed only POST requests, so GET requests even to correct url resulted in 405 response
2. When POST requests were actually made, two wrong urls were used for all the POST requests  
   a. http://…/api/ → resulted in 302 response  
   b. https://…/api → resulted in a 307  
   whereas the url I gave was of the format “https://…/api/”

The logs from Cloud Run  
[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/0/a/0aec52c2574797f9b3c56589104b77ef4c82bb6d_2_690x387.png)image982×552 133 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/0/a/0aec52c2574797f9b3c56589104b77ef4c82bb6d.png "image")

As you can see from the above logs, all POST requests made to my app have the wrong url, some have only http and some end with “/api” instead of “/api/”, both of which do not match with the correct url I gave in the Google Form (screenshot attached below).

[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/5/6/568addb34b3014bc9b4c0735ff554a6fbc1ca2c4_2_644x500.png)image831×645 41.7 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/6/568addb34b3014bc9b4c0735ff554a6fbc1ca2c4.png "image")

I request you to re-evaluate my project 2 with the correct url exactly as I had submitted in the Google Form.

Thank you.  
Regards,  
Shivaditya

My IITM student dashboard on the portal shows absent for course project (COURSE PROJET - Absent). Is this referring to project 1 or 2? Coz i missed Project 1 but submitted Project 2 successfully. Also the logs show that the evaluation was performed on the submitted enpoint. So should I be concerned about the dashboard showing ‘Absent’ or will it be updated in a few days?

We cant specify a clear deadline. If we could we would. At the present time there are roughly 100+ evals left in the pipeline. And we retry them to give students the best chance of getting a score. Sometimes we accomodate some unusual situations that we have been made aware of but all of those interrupt our workflows and so it takes time. Which makes this process a little unpredictable.

This is the first term where we have had students deploy solutions that require significant compute resources on our end to evaluate. So there was always going to be hickups. But i think that we have delivered an equally enriching learning experience as a result which is enough to land you an actual job. (Might not be so enriching on your CGPA admittedly, but thats a small price to pay for invaluable skills you hopefully have gained)

This is a gentle reminder to kindly send the confirmation email indicating for whom the evaluation of Project 2 has been completed.

Additionally, I would like to confirm whether we can shut down our Azure VM after this, or if we should keep it running in case there is an additional evaluation. In one of the sessions, you had mentioned the possibility of offering alternate questions as a second chance for students, evaluated at half the original marking scheme (i.e., 2 marks per question).

Hello [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) , [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Sir When i test it locally , my LLM is working fine , even running the app , it gave result in 2 sec ,  
I dont know what happened in the logs , it was showing some runtime error ,  
As i am using free plan of vercel , so it allow for 10 sec only ,  
I think any heavy file being run , so it just take some more time , more than 10 sec , but inbuild feature of free plan allow to run only 10 sec … and thats why this happened , i guess

does it means , my LLM failed ??  
Can you please try some other question , it will work , or even for heavy question it work ,  
You can check its working from interface too  
Please check once !!

Would it be possible for you to allow me to make this change, or kindly update the link on my behalf? I sincerely apologize for the confusion, and I’d be truly grateful for your support and understanding.

Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,

But Sir please give some bonus , As in earlier terms , everyone got S grade in TDS , without doing anything , and from this term the difficulty level increased rapidly , just like e^x  
Although I know that our LLM doesnt worked fully(100%) , but atleast they worked 50-60%  
We have learned so many things and try to implement in it too,…

Atleast give some bonus for our hardwork , and participating in both LLM project , so even we dont get S grade , but will get B , A , grade … and our CGPA doesn’t decrease much  
because projects hold the major chunk in grading

It seems you have provided a local address endpoint, which means it will only work on your computer. If I run it on my computer, it will redirect to my port 8000 if it is running.

[@carlton](/u/carlton),[@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  
sir my roll number is 23f2004462

Due to an unexpected power outage, my PC shut down abruptly, causing my local server and ngrok tunnel to terminate. When the system rebooted, I restarted the server and ngrok, which generated a new API endpoint as ngrok URLs are temporary and change with every session. The previous endpoint is no longer accessible, and the new one now serves as the API endpoint. I understand the need for a consistent URL and will explore solutions like reserving a domain through ngrok’s paid plan to prevent such issues in the future. Apologies for any inconvenience caused, and thank you for understanding.

New project 2 url:- <https://96c8-2401-4900-6290-6a14-b433-2faa-a056-a6e5.ngrok-free.app/api/>

The link provided is also working one but this link has the frontend part not the url endpoint.  
kindly evaluate me on the basis of the updated link : <https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/>

I have received this message do this message suggest that my evaluation is successfully completed coz I forgot to add /api at the end of my vercel url . Or is it like the submission had ran but ultimately produced my score 0. If this is the case I request you to reevaluate my submission.

Respected Course Team,

Harsh this side from NIT Allahabad, I am writing to inform you that I received a notification  
[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/4/7/47982d17f0f05b64a27e4f066b996127987dadf9_2_690x379.png)image2096×1154 160 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/4/7/47982d17f0f05b64a27e4f066b996127987dadf9.png "image")  
regarding an issue with my submission.

I believe the issue may have occurred because I had mistakenly provided an incorrect API endpoint in my earlier submission. However, my server is still actively running on Vercel  
<https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app>  
and the correct API endpoint is:

correct api : <https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/>

Everything else in the project is functioning as expected. I kindly request you to re-evaluate my submission using the correct endpoint as i am currently in my 3rd year of BTech Chemical engineering at NIT Allahabad and my placement session is coming so i don’t want to get failed in this course due to such a small mistake.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Most of us have hosted our projects in Azure and this is costing us real money .. We have just gotten to a stage where if you could just please let us know if our endpoints have been evaluated and there is some score we will happily take it down.  
Kindly bear in mind the there is a financial component ( some of us have free accounts ) involved here and I urge and request you to kindly expedite the evaluation process so that we decrease the financial burden placed upon us by this exercise…

I just got the mail stating that my evaluation is complete and I can turn off my server.  
However the Cloud Run logs show that all POST requests were made to the wrong end point.

The exact url I gave ends with “/api/” but every POST request was either made to “/api” which resulted in a 307 response or with “http” instead of “https” which resulted in a 302 response. Only the get requests were made to the correct endpoint but since the app was supposed to allow POST requests only, making GET requests just resulted in 405.

Hello sir,  
I apologize for bothering you again.  
About 30 minutes ago, I received an email stating that project 2 has been evaluated. However, when I checked my IP stats, I found there is no special API access. You can verify this. I want to understand whether this is just a wrong email I received or if there is an issue with your system’s evaluation. Please clarify this doubt, as I am unable to focus on my final term exam.  
i closed my local machine too I spent one month on this project please consider my problem

I checked my Vercel logs and saw that the requests were sent to the /api endpoint instead of the /api/ endpoint that I specifically gave in the google forms.

To confirm this I also sent a request to /api and /api/ enpoints and the /api gave a 404 error while /api/ gave a 200 message.

Please look into this

Dear Sir,  
In my course dashboard, it shows project 2 status as absent, but i have already submitted the repo and api points well before deadline in the given forum. Still my vercel server is running and api is resolving as expected. Please look into this matter, because I already had issue in my project 1 and lost marks in that. Expecting a positive response from your end.

Hello Sir, my project 2 score is showing as 0. I had got email saying please update endpoint because earlier endpoint was having problems. I had sent <https://c7f6-150-107-43-5.ngrok-free.app/api/> as updated endpoint in google form on April 10th. Same day I had got around 9 requests on that endpoint around 4:56 PM. They were 200 OK requests on /api/ and 4 requests were 307 redirect on /api. I presume they were from TDS team. Next day got email to shut off endpoint. I had tested endpoint locally and on ngrok. Both were fine. Was the updated endpoint in the google form evaluated? Was there some problem with the updated endpoint?

Namaste Sir. The projects have been quite challenging, and I have applied my knowledge to the best of my ability. I’ve submitted the project but it’s showing 0 in the portal. Bonus marks for creating APIs and so in the projects would be greatly appreciated. I am planning to start my degree in the upcoming term, and this is the last subject I am completing at this level. So, I kindly request your assistance, sir.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) sir ,  
I am writing to kindly request a re-evaluation of my Project 2 submission. As I had previously mentioned, the Render deployment link I submitted may take approximately **50 to 60 seconds** to activate upon the first load. This behavior is typical of free-tier deployments on Render, and I assure you that the application functions correctly in both **Podman** and **Linux** environments.

Upon reviewing my Render logs, I could not find any indication that the project was accessed or evaluated during the expected activation time. To ensure smooth accessibility, I have also deployed the same GitHub repository on **Railway** and submitted that link as well.

If possible, I kindly request either of the following:

1. Re-evaluation using the **Railway link** I provided, or
2. Re-evaluation using the **Render link**, with allowance for the 50–60 second activation time.

Your consideration and understanding in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if any further clarification or information is needed.

Thank you for your support and guidance.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) I knew that this affected my project 2 score and that’s why I made that post(the one to which I’m replying in this message). Please look into this. My api is working and still on and will be on till 18th April when my credits will run out. Please re-evaluate my project 2 with the exact url I gave in the form. My project 2 was evaluated on the wrong url and this led to a zero in the project 2 score.

Hi sir [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)

I need your immediate attention regarding my project-2, as I received zero marks, but my server is running completely fine. Below are the key points that I need you to look into:

![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") **Server is running and reachable. and Giving Correct Answers**  
![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") **GET and POST requests tested via Postman and VS Code**, both return **200 OK**.  
![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") **Tested on my laptop and by 10+ other people** – all received correct results.  
![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") **No issues seen in logs or deployment** – everything was set up properly.  
![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") **Others in my group got full marks** – we worked on the same project.

![:red_exclamation_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/red_exclamation_mark.png?v=14 ":red_exclamation_mark:") **I have no idea what went wrong during the evaluation.**  
![:red_exclamation_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/red_exclamation_mark.png?v=14 ":red_exclamation_mark:") **I’ve spent weeks working on this project**, including sleepless nights.  
![:red_exclamation_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/red_exclamation_mark.png?v=14 ":red_exclamation_mark:") **This is my last term** – if I fail, I will have to repeat the entire diploma.

Please recheck my project thoroughly. Here are the important links for you to verify:

* **API Documentation:** [FastAPI - Swagger UI](http://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs)
* **API Endpoint:** <http://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api>

I truly believe that my server is functioning as expected, and I just need a re-evaluation to confirm that.

I’ve put in a lot of effort into this, and I sincerely request that you review it again.

as you can see my vm is working fine here

Due to this, my score stands 0 as of now.

Dear Sir,

In my course dashboard, Project 2 score is shown as zero. However, I had submitted the repository and API endpoints (<http://35.192.157.22.80>) through the Google Form. I had received a mail to make edit in API end point if changed. I had edited my api end point by adding /api/ and it was <http://35.192.157.22/api/>. My server was running fine. I have worked hard to do this project and now receiving a score of zero. Kindly look into it.

Request a re-evaluation of my **Project 2** score. Despite submitting the project as per the given deadlines, my portal currently shows a score of **0**.

I have cross-checked my submissions and believe there may have been an error in evaluation or in updating the marks.

Dear Sir, [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
I need your immediate attention regarding my **project-2 , as I received zero marks,** but **my server is running completely fine**. Below are the key points that I need you to look into:

Server is running and reachable. and Giving The Correct Answers

GET and POST requests tested via Postman and VS Code, both return 200 OK.

Tested on my laptop and by 10+ other people – all received correct results.

No issues seen in logs or deployment – everything was set up properly.

Others in my group got full marks – we worked on the same project.

I have no idea what went wrong during the evaluation.

I’ve spent weeks working on this project, including sleepless nights.  
Cant have least scores despite all the efforts.

Please recheck my project thoroughly. Here are the important links for you to verify:  
**API Documentation: [FastAPI - Swagger UI](https://bhavanaproj2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs)**

**I truly believe that my server is functioning as expected, and I just need a re-evaluation to confirm that.  
I’ve put in a lot of effort into this, and I sincerely request that you review it again.  
Please don’t ignore this.

My marks are also showing as zero.

My suggestion is to provide students with the logs of your evaluation script, so we know if it is that server was not reachable, the answer is incorrect, or the response format was incorrect..etc

Request you to let us know if there is going to be re-evaluation so we can get the Azure instance running again

Please check it out. My app can remain deployed only till April 18th. In the Cloud Run logs, I do see some multiple POST requests made today with 200 response but I’m not sure whether it was the TDS team doing a re-evaluation or someone else.

Also, are there any updates on [this bug in project 1 in datagen.](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/451)

Thanks.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) I also received 20 in project 2 which I think is not correct. I also tested my api with questions with different parameters to make sure it is giving correct responses with questions with variable parameters. You are requested to kindly recheck and share the evaluation logs.

Sir, Same here, you can access it via this link [Assignment solver](https://phoenix-1743854088883.staticrun.app/)

I kindly request you to check immediately by this link as I also have made it as an web app for your ease.

(my friends: please don’t use the link, as the api token request will be over)

Please look after it, already I was marked as absent for project -1 and now for this project -2 as 0. I don’t know why?..I don’t know whether I could be able to pass this course even with lots of efforts..

I am also seeing a score of 0. This is after the course TA’s said that I had scored well on the project without revealing my score. But I am pretty sure they won’t classify 0/100 as a good score.

You were not present in the form Anand gave us. It most likely because you submitted after the deadline (or made edits after the deadline, if the form he shared allowed edits).

I’m writing to clarify the status of my Project 2, which is currently marked as “Absent”. I would like to respectfully state that I **submitted the form before the deadline** — specifically on 31st March 2025 at 22:11 , and I have the response copy as proof.

I would also like to emphasize that:

No edits were made to the form after submission.  
I did not make any changes to the project or submission after the deadline.  
My Vercel API is still active and functioning as expected.

Here are the submitted links:

I sincerely apologize for not using my official email address — it was an honest oversight and not an attempt to bypass any rules. I’d be truly grateful if you could kindly consider evaluating my project based on the valid, timely submission and the active working links provided.

This situation is quite distressing for me, as it could result in a significant setback, potentially requiring me to repeat the entire course. I fully acknowledge that the mistake was mine — a small yet critical one — and I sincerely request that if there is even a slight possibility of evaluation, please consider it.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to assist with verification. Your understanding and support would genuinely mean a lot.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respected Carlton Sir,  
I thought in gform we need to submit the deployment url:

[tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app](https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/)

### [TDS Solver](https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/)

but for the API testing we need to add /api/ to the url:

<https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/api/>

Please do my evaluation on this link, its the same just we need to go to /api/ in the URL

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

Dear Sirs,

I apologize for the inconvenience caused by reaching out again. I came to know that many students have received an email stating that the re-evaluation for Project 2 will be conducted today between 11 PM and 2 AM. However, I have not received any such communication on my end.

I would like to bring to your attention that I actively helped several peers deploy their servers on Vercel and resolve various issues, and many of them received marks as high as 80. Unfortunately, my own record still shows as “Absent,” despite the fact that I submitted the Google Form well before the deadline and my server has been live and running for over two weeks.

For your verification, I am attaching screenshots of my GitHub repository and the Vercel deployment dashboard, which clearly show the deployment.

I sincerely request you to kindly consider this issue. This situation has caused significant mental stress, especially as I had already faced a grading issue in Project 1. The anxiety and uncertainty around my Project 2 score have negatively affected my focus during the end-term exam and viva for other projects as well. Receiving a zero in this project would only further impact my overall performance and morale, despite the genuine effort I have put in.

I genuinely hope for a positive response and a fair re-evaluation.

Thank you very much for your time and understanding.

Respected Sir,  
Sir I made a mistake while submitting the GFORM in hurry, I submitted the deployment URL instead of API URL:  
currently for re-evaluation my URL that I received on my mail id is:

`https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/`

but for API testing we need to add /api/ to the URL so final URL is:

`https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/api/`

I’m sorry for this mistake sir, please accept this small change, we just need to add /api/ to the URL

Thank you

actually 2 of my friend had submitted similar url with no /api/ but he got 80 marks and I also submitted without /api/ url but I got 0 so for re evaluation sir please add /api/ to the original URL as mentioned Above Please Sir

Thank you

I would like to clarify that I had submitted the form before the deadline. However, I believe I might have submitted it once again after the deadline, just to ensure that my project was submitted correctly.  
Please find attached the screenshot of my submission made before the deadline. Also, I haven’t received any response sheet for the form submitted after the deadline.

So anyone with an ngrok endpoint can send their new ngrok to us, but obviously you will need to start the server up much sooner than 11 in that case. An email will be sent to you specifically. DO NOT give us the endpoint on discourse. Reply to the email we will send specifically for you.

Dear Sir,

I’m sorry to bother you again, but I’m in a desperate situation and have no other option but to reach out through this channel.

As I mentioned in my previous message, my score has been marked as “absent,” even though I submitted my project well before the deadline. Additionally, I have not received any communication regarding a re-evaluation.

I kindly request you to look into this matter and provide a response at the earliest.

\***Request to Use Public DNS for Course Tool API Deployment or Use Alternate Endpoint**

Dear [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

I hope you’re doing well!

I’m currently running my server and trying to access the API hosted at:

```
https://sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app/api/

```

However, I’m encountering the following error:

```
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app

```

After some investigation, I found that the issue is related to DNS resolution. The API becomes accessible when using **public DNS services** like **Google (8.8.8.8)** or **Cloudflare (1.1.1.1)**. This suggests that the current deployment environment may be using a restricted or unreliable DNS resolver, which causes access issues on some networks (e.g., Jio).

---

### :hammer_and_wrench: Suggested Fix:

To ensure reliable access for all students, could you please consider updating the deployment or testing environment to use a **public DNS** provider?

Recommended options:

* **Google DNS**: `8.8.8.8`, `8.8.4.4`
* **Cloudflare DNS**: `1.1.1.1`, `1.0.0.1`

This can typically be configured via Docker settings or the environment’s networking configuration.

---

### :repeat_button: Alternate Option:

If the DNS change isn’t possible at the moment, I kindly request that you evaluate my project using the **previously deployed endpoint** instead:

```
https://tds-project-2-pnlm.onrender.com/api/

```

Please note that this endpoint may take **50 to 60 seconds** to respond, as it’s hosted on a platform with a cold start delay — but it is fully functional and provides the correct outputs.

Both endpoints are currently active and return identical results.

---

Thank you so much for your time and support — I truly appreciate the effort you’re putting into helping us succeed in this course!

Best regards,  
**Sahil Raj**

Dear [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

In the google form which we submitted I had pasted the API endpoint as the one which I got in the vercel dashboard i.e. <https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/>  
whereas the correct api for giving post requests has **/api** added to the above which i forgot to add. i.e\*\*.[https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/api/\*\*](https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/api/**)  
I have checked again and the post requests are working.  
I know that I made a mistake in the form and regret the same. If possible, please evaluate my project 2 with the above endpoint

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to kindly request the addition of an API to the link I previously submitted for Project 2. I realized that including this API is essential for the complete functionality and demonstration of the project.

please use this api url -: <https://rahulbot-a369.onrender.com/api/>  
instead of this - <https://rahulbot-a369.onrender.com/>

Thank you for your time and support. Looking forward to your response.

Hi Jivraj,

I would like to draw attention to a specific question regarding the process of creating an HTML file and publishing it to GitHub. I notice that I am not providing a preloaded answer when this question arises. Instead, it creates a new repository and an HTML file, then deploys it on GitHub. Initially, it presents a URL, but I understand that your server checks to verify whether the URL contains valid HTML. This verification process takes time, which can lead to an incorrect response when checking the URL right after deployment.

At that moment, the URL might not display the HTML content or be verified by your server, even though eventually, the deployment is successful and the URL is correct. Please keep in mind that publishing to GitHub requires some time; it’s not feasible to expedite this process drastically, to my knowledge.

I checked and noted that this question has been asked recently.

Additionally, I believe the image may show your server’s IP address.

Ok. Because our gform of 10th April has old ngrok endpoint which isnt valid now. Only the one which we have emailed to [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) before 10:30 PM is current active. So i conclude our emailed ngrok endpoints of today to [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) are enough.

Sir, I had submitted the project on 31st March at 11:30 PM itself. However, I made a change to the Vercel endpoint and updated it on 1st April. I can provide a screenshot of the Vercel deployment as proof. Unfortunately, I didn’t keep a copy of the Google Form submission. But to be honest, I shared the deployed project with some of my friends on 1st and 2nd April, after my edit, and they submitted it through the form after me. They received marks, but I haven’t received the same.

Sorry, Sir. I just realized the reason why my submission was not considered — I had used the email ID I created specifically for my MAD2 project. It was a genuine mistake on my part. However, I noticed in a previous thread that another student who submitted using a different email ID was given a chance to update it. I kindly request you to consider giving me the same opportunity as well.  
I have given my endpoint to the gform circulated in this thread.

We didn’t account for such cases. The purpose of that form was to reevaluate only those who submitted using their IITM email but had provided the wrong endpoint.

Anyone who didn’t use their IITM email during submission—even if they later filled out the form—was filtered out and not considered for reevaluation.

Hi Team,

Yesterday, I received a mail stating that our **Project 2** would be **reevaluated between 11 PM and 2 AM tonight**, and that the following endpoint would be used to test the API:

![:link:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/link.png?v=14 ":link:") <https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/>

However, I have not seen any logs in Railway during that timeframe, and my score on the dashboard is still showing as **0**.

Could you please confirm if my URL was actually reevaluated?

Thank you!

Yesterday I received the mail to start my server from 11 pm to 2 am, but I am very sorry that I did not read the mail on time and hence could not start the server on time. I request you kindly to give a second chance for re evaluation. I have done the project and it would not be fair if it is not evaluated.

However, I haven’t seen any deployment logs on Railway during that timeframe, and my score on the dashboard is still showing as 0.

Could you please confirm whether my Project 2 was actually reevaluated?

Yes, the new page took about 5–10 seconds to go live after the GitHub repository was created when we used Gmail as a parameter.  
If the Gmail is fixed, we can hardcode it in advance.  
In our case, Gmail is a parameter, so the function should remain dynamic and it would take 5-10 second to go live after we received answer.

sir my project 2 is also showing 0 but it was working. pls check if it was not working at least give some marks for the effort that w have put. I also accept that we have learnt a lot in this course and marks doesnot matter. but after putting a lot of effort day and night getting a zero, gives a drastic discouragement to even look at the laptop. pls consider if possible.

I have completed and submitted the assigned project 2, and I have verified that it is working correctly as per the given instructions.

However, I noticed that the score awarded to me for the project is 0. I believe this may be an error, as my project meets the required criteria and functions as expected.

I kindly request you to review my submission and let me know if there was any issue during evaluation or submission that may have led to this result.

I have deployed the project on vercel as instructed.  
I have uploaded all the links in google form and submitted it.

To support this, I am attaching a screenshot of the PowerShell window that shows an example of my application running successfully for one of the questions.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) I appreciate the team incorporating my updated response at the endpoint with the “/api” path and re-evaluating accordingly, as well as sharing the results via email.

To my surprise, when I invoke the same endpoint that was evaluated — using the correct multipart/form-data payload with both question and file fields — I consistently receive a 200 OK response with the expected output.

Moreover, if I omit either field from the form-data, the server returns the exact validation error mentioned in the re-evaluation report, which makes sense. Based on this behavior and the details in the shared report, I’d like to confirm: during the re-evaluation, was the request payload indeed sent with both question and file fields included in the form-data?

For reference, I’ve attached a screenshot demonstrating the response.

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
this was one of the question it asked on api  
‘’‘{  
“api”: “<https://app.algsoch.tech/api/>”,  
“test\_code”: “GA2\_q3”,  
“status”: “FAILED”,  
“actual”: “ tag not found”,  
“expected”: “24f2006438@ds.study.iitm.ac.in”  
},’‘’  
Now I am demonstrating that my HTML page includes an email tag. You can see it here.

“expected”: “[The 2FA app that tells you when you get `314159`](https://blog.jacobstechtavern.com/p/building-a-2fa-app-that-detects-patterns)”  
}  
I am unsure of the exact question, but it seems that the question can be modified with search terms and points. For example, in the account, it was stated as [‘text editor’, at least 77 points’]. If this were the parameter, then my answer would be correct, and I have proof.

Case 3: JSON Key Count – XF Parameter (GA5\_q7)

{

“api”: “<https://app.algsoch.tech/api/>”,

“test\_code”: “GA5\_q7”,

“status”: “ERROR”,

“error”: “invalid literal for int() with base 10: ‘Error: Invalid JSON in the file. Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)’”

}

#### :memo: What Was Expected:

The question required developing a script that:

* Parses a large, deeply nested JSON log file, and
* Counts how many times a specific key — represented by XF — appears in the JSON structure.

It was explicitly stated that:

* Only key matches for XF are to be counted, not values.
* The file to be used was:  
  E:\data science tool\GA5\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json

#### :white_check_mark: What I Did:

I used the correct approach, parsing the nested JSON file and counting how many times the key XF appeared throughout the structure.

Here’s the actual response I got using this cURL command:

curl -X POST <https://app.algsoch.tech/api/> \

-H “accept: application/json” \

-F “question=…How many times does XF appear as a key?” \

-F “file=@E:\data science tool\GA5\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json”

API Output:{“answer”:“14602”}

This indicates that my logic worked correctly and the key XF appeared 14,602 times, exactly as intended.

#### :warning: What Went Wrong on API Side:

The API returned a parsing error, indicating:

“invalid literal for int() with base 10: ‘Error: Invalid JSON in the file…’”

However:

* My file was valid JSON, properly parsed.
* The actual issue seems to be on the API’s side — possibly mishandling the file read or decoding before passing it to the evaluator.
* It may have expected an integer but received a string-wrapped error or non-integer data, causing it to crash.

#### :light_bulb: Insight:

If the original question was about counting the key XF, my solution was 100% correct.

However, if the question dynamically changed the key name or added extra criteria (e.g., only count if value == true, or only under a certain section), then the result might differ. But from the default XF-focused question, my logic and result match perfectly.

If my evaluation of project 2 is not done then i will fail the tds course and will have to repeat this course which will cause a financial strain on me

I know that it is difficult for you to consider this request but it is my humblest request if you can just look through the project i tried to complete the project with the best of my abilities

Good Afternoon Sir.  
This is regarding project 1 and project 2.

**Project-1 Evaluation**  
Sir, For the project 1, I have written the code, uploaded in GitHub and the dockerfile image is created and uploaded successfully.  
Sir, I already contacted regarding Project - 1, you said to check it by replicating the test environment. I did till running the dockerfile but I needed evaluate.py sir, which I didn’t get it. I got only 5 marks sir. Can you please check my code once sir and verify it as I have written the code and the dockerfile is running successfully.

**Project-2 Evaluation**  
Regarding project 2 also, I have uploaded my code in GitHub and deployed my app in Vercel. But, I got 0 sir. Can you check my code once again and verify it? According to the guidance given, I deployed my app through Vercel. The app got deployed but I am getting 404 Error, even after trying any troubleshooting method. Maybe, Vercel is in development stage.

Sir, but I wrote the code and deployed, but I got 0 marks only. Please check it and guide me to get it corrected. Sir, due to the projects I got poor marks on TDS. Please, I request you to re-evaluate and give me correct marks.

In anticipation of quick response  
Thank You

Hi everyone,

I know that some of you might be feeling anxious about your scores etc. We are currently in the process of validating your scores on all the projects, roe, assignments, exam and bonus, so we will not be able to respond quickly to each individual post here for the time being.

Once we validate, you will receive an email with your official scores that we will be pushing to Operations in a single update. Along with that email you will receive a discrepancy form where you can raise your issues. This will give us a consolidated view of problems and fix them.

Kindly wait for the email to come to you. It will be sent sometime this afternoon.

Kind regards,

TDS Team

I am also receiving the odd GET requests, however, I don’t believe these are being sent by the evaluation teams. Our endpoints are open to internet and there are bots everywhere which will send these kind of random requests to scan for potential exploit/hacking targets.

Just recieved this on my mail. Happy that everything worked out pretty well w/o the need for hardcoding. I’m guessing GA1-q18 bugged out because of escape sequences in the codeblock ![:joy:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/joy.png?v=14 ":joy:") That’s LLMs for you!

Can’t expect 100% reliability, even at 0 temperature.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  
I would like to bring to your attention that the project URL I submitted was accessible and working correctly in my browser, even without the “http” or “https” prefix. A friend of mine submitted a similar URL and received full marks. Furthermore, I have updated my URL using HTTPS via Google Forms, so I kindly request you to consider evaluating my project using the latest URL provided.

This is a humble request, as I am currently at risk of receiving a grade ‘E’, which will significantly impact my overall CGPA. As an alternative, I am also willing to retake the course in the next term and pay the fee again if needed.

In the P1, unfortunately scored zero due to a minor mistake and was not given an opportunity to correct it. I truly believe that in real-life scenarios, we are often given chances to rectify such errors, and I sincerely hope for the same consideration here.

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand)  
**Subject:** Request to Share My Student-Built TDS Assistant Platform

Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope you’re doing well.

I’m **Vicky Kumar**, a student from the Data Science and Applications program at **IIT Madras**. Over the last few months, I’ve built a personal project called **“Vicky App”** — a smart assistant platform specifically designed to help students in courses like **TDS,**.

The system is capable of:

* Accurately solving over **90% of assignment-style questions** using regex and phonetic matching
* Dynamically executing the right code logic based on the student’s input
* Processing uploaded files such as Excel, PDF, CSV, and JSON
* Delivering instant answers, completely independent of ChatGPT or any external LLM

You can test the platform here: <https://app.algsoch.tech>

---

### :light_bulb: What’s in it for students:

* They type their question, and the backend executes the correct solution automatically
* Especially helpful for GA preparation, understanding problem logic, and reducing repetitive workload
* I’ve made it **free for the first 3 questions**
* After that, students can access the full platform for just **₹199/month**, which helps me cover system maintenance and hosting costs

---

### :folded_hands: My Humble Request:

This is a tool I’ve built with immense effort and love for this course, and I genuinely believe it can benefit many students.

To sustain the platform — hosting, APIs, file management, and backend orchestration — I’ve introduced a small paid model after a free trial.

I would be extremely grateful if you could test it once and, if you find it helpful, consider sharing it with upcoming students or mentioning it in a Moodle announcement.

It’s built *by an IIT Madras student, for IIT Madras students* — with the sole goal of making their learning smoother, faster, and smarter.

Thank you so much for your time and support.

Warm regards,  
**Vicky Kumar**  
B.S. Data Science and Applications, IIT Madras

It’s a tool built by a fellow IITM student, with deep respect for the academic rigor of this program — not to replace learning, but to accelerate it.

Please let me know if you’d like a walkthrough, or if any suggestions for improvements arise.

# Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread

### Creating this Thread to share answers and questions from your respective assignments

### Why? :interrobang::thinking:

If we can Train the LLM with these Questions already, we can easily do well?

### Too many Questions for LLM :nerd_face::nerd_face::nerd_face:

True we can use embeddings, map that stored in-system dictionary and use relevant questions from in-system data to send as context with answer

### What We need from YOU 🫵🏽

Get to scraping your respective Graded Assignments and post the it?

### How?

* If answers are saved, Just Print (Ctrl+P) and save pdf, not really if this would work
* If you had saved code for each question, send the saved code and with a docstring as the question , This would be useful ![:+1:t3:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/+1/3.png?v=12 ":+1:t3:")![:+1:t3:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/+1/3.png?v=12 ":+1:t3:")

The answer choices for questions 1 and 2 in graded assignment 6 are quite confusing. Both questions are single-select, yet three out of the four options are correct in each case. I’m unsure whether to choose one of the correct options or if the question is actually asking for the incorrect one. Could someone please clarify?

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  
I have similar concern  
For Q1, I used the following code:

```
print(f'Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column')
kk = df[df['State'] == 'Karnataka']
for col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:
    pearson_corr = kk['price_retention'].corr(kk[col])
    print(f'\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:.2f}')

```

And got the following output:

```
Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column
	Mileage (km/l)            : 0.03
	Avg Daily Distance (km)   : -0.06
	Engine Capacity (cc)      : -0.04

```

Whereas options are below where none of them are correct.  
[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/6/a6fa9a2e601c94da84cbd25c406235d1009b204c.png)image281×219 9.1 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/6/a6fa9a2e601c94da84cbd25c406235d1009b204c.png "image")

Whereas for Q2 (Punjab and Yamaha) I used the following code:

```
print(f'Pearson correlation for Punjab and Yamaha between price retention and column')
pb = df[(df['State'] == 'Punjab') & (df['Brand'] == 'Yamaha')]
for col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:
    pearson_corr = pb['price_retention'].corr(pb[col])
    print(f'\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:.2f}')

```

and got the following answers:

```
Pearson correlation for Punjab and Yamaha between price retention and column
	Mileage (km/l)            : 0.24
	Avg Daily Distance (km)   : -0.06
	Engine Capacity (cc)      : -0.08

```

The options for Q2 are given below and 2 of them are correct (AvgDistance and Mileage).

I guess for both Q1 & Q2, we need to find the option that is having stronger correlation (positive/negative). Please correct me if I am wrong.

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  
Dear TDS Team,

There are multiple issues in Graded Assignment 6 that require urgent attention:

1. Questions 1 and 2, along with their options, are ambiguous.
2. In Questions 3 and 4, I am unable to obtain an exact answer that matches any of the given options, despite trying multiple approaches, including the Excel regression method and other models in a Google Colab file.
3. The data for Question 10 is missing. I attempted to run the shapefile in QGIS, but it resulted in an error. Additionally, I searched for the shapefile of New York roads on official websites, but their servers are currently under maintenance.

The assignment deadline is approaching, but these issues remain unresolved. Kindly look into this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution as soon as possible.

Thank you for your support.

Yes, there are no specifics in Q1 to Q4 and are quite ambiguous.

For instance:

> forecast the 2027 resale value of the Hero - HF Deluxe in Gujarat, using historical data.

but is this talking about the average resale value as no input features are specified?

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
My question 7 for GA6 is :  
A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance  
Whose options provided are :  
10418 meters

12287 meters

10965 meters

11149 meters

However, after trying all methods out there my distance comes out to be 6873 meters, I selected 10418 as the answer (closest approximation to 6873 meters)

I assume that the question must have been central command post to summit shores village (whose answer turns out to be 12287 meters)  
Kindly look into the question, and let me know about the same (the destination from central command post)

Hello Sir,

Can you please check if this is the right answer. As per email received from [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir we should select the absolute maximum value.  
[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/b/4/b468c32e53fddf462c583b8664f183dd7afe37aa_2_690x277.png)image978×393 23.3 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/4/b468c32e53fddf462c583b8664f183dd7afe37aa.png "image")

Example : If we get answers as -0.3 and 0.2 then -0.3 is the right answer as it’s absolut value is maximum.

For the first question the correlation matrix is as follows,  
[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/c/5/c524c9f7645716e0fac9d8850df15c4c20af05dc_2_690x397.png)image748×431 17.5 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/5/c524c9f7645716e0fac9d8850df15c4c20af05dc.png "image")

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
I did raise the question 2 days before the GA6 Deadline and doing so again after being marked as incorrect

My question 7 was A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance

10418 meters

12287 meters

10965 meters

11149 meters

Whose right answer turned out 6873, however the answer pushed is 12287 meters, which is nowhere near the closest options (it would’ve been correct if the destination was summit shores village which isn’t the case with this question)

Also, my question 4 was :  
As an investment analyst monitoring motorcycle resale values, develop a forecasting model to predict future resale prices by brand and segment, considering seasonality and long-term trends. Specifically, forecast the 2027 resale value of the Kawasaki - Ninja 300 in Tamil Nadu, using historical data.

134483

94774

150666

199711

Whose correct option (through different methods and algorithms) was approximately closest to 94774 and again answer pushed is 150666 which again turns out to be incorrect

So is the case with questions 1 and 2 (where answers aren’t pushed according to absolute values, but as conveyed earlier, I believe this shall be resolved)

Kindly look into it

Thanks and Regards

Just to confirm, were the answers shown on the portal correct because I’m getting the same score as shown in the portal.

Did you submit before 1:47? If yes, then your highest score will be taken.  
If not then, you will be marked absent.

Dear Sir,

I would like to bring this to your attention that even though I submitted the ROE multiple times, the dashboard is showing absent.

I hope the issue will be resolved at earliest as I am not the only one facing this issue

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir,

I wanted to bring to your attention that, although as you are already aware that I was present for the ROE and successfully submitted my exam, my dashboard currently reflects my status as “Absent.”

I have attached a screenshot for your reference. I assume this might be a backend issue or that the scores are still being updated. Could you kindly look into this and confirm?

Thank you

24F1001631 here. It is also showing absent for me. I had submitted before the time limit and also after the time limit after hacking it(wasn’t sure if it was allowed but decided to try it nevertheless)

I feel I should atleast receive the marks for which I had submitted within the time limit.

My roll number is 24F1001631.

We have not yet updated the scores for ROE (there are roughly 130 students affected by the previous update). So just wait till it gets pushed by operations (most likely Tuesday). I can assure you that we have the right scores on our server, there is just an issue when “transporting” those scores over to the operations team, which we have now rectified and since scores are batch processed it will happen over night during a server update.

Bottom line: wait till Tuesday  
Both bonus and your actual roe scores will reflect on dashboard by then.  
If not let us know

Kind regards.

Hi Carlton,  
I am writing to confirm the basic requirements for successfully completing the course.

As I understand, the criteria for passing are:

1. Achieving a score greater than 40 marks in the graded assignments.
2. Securing more than 40 marks in the end-term examination.

Could you kindly confirm if this understanding is accurate? Additionally, please let me know if there are any other prerequisites to be met.

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton),  
I was working on GA7 as part of Task 4 in 7.1. In task 4.Sheet1, the columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. While I could extract Series ID and Item, I couldn’t locate Year, Month, or Value in the dataset. Could someone please assist me with this?

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir,  
I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the initial peer grading email.

Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded?

Sir,  
In case we are not provided access to view their respective sheets, we would have no option but to either leave the column blank or mark it as 0. However, if others have marked it differently based on their available information, there is a possibility that our responses may vary — potentially exceeding the permissible variance limit of ±33%.

In such a scenario, would this mean we would not be eligible for the bonus?

Additionally, it would be really helpful if a uniform approach or standard marking could be communicated for such cases where access is not granted. This would ensure consistency across all submissions and avoid discrepancies arising from random or subjective entries, which seems to be happening currently.

If you are not provided access, contact the peer. Their email is there in the html file. It’s in the peers interest **and** yours. That’s an important aspect of GA7, it’s to get people to work together and collaborate.  
Peer reviews like the real world is going to be messy. The way to reduce the messiness is to communicate with one another.

You have two options. Get in touch with the peer (you have their email address), this is the recommended approach. Or you could give them zero because you were not able to evaluate their submission.

In every TDS assignment after the first, I have not seen a submit button in the assignment page so I could not submit it there( I see it in the sanand portal and submit it there)

Now, my assignment score for all assignments (2,3,4,5) shows 0

I am attaching SS of my assignment-5 page to show there was no submit button available there

I had raised this as a ticket in the Support desk(21/Feb) in the past as discourse was not available to me at that time, but this didn’t get resolved. I saw a similar older thread where it was mentioned that this is not something to worry about but now it is showing in the portal that I am not allowed to take the End Term Exam. What can be done for this?

[@22f3001561](/u/22f3001561) GA5 like all the prior GAs for TDS Jan 25 term were all to be submitted through the graded assignment page. Which is in the link provided (it is actually in the screen shot you have provided).  
All the previous GA 1 through 4 were also exactly the same.

We have no evidence you ever submitted any of the other GAs except GA1.

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Dear TDS Team,

I hope you are doing well. I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution.

### 1. Graded Assignments (GA)

* **GA6 Doubts Unresolved:** While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. [(Thread link)](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/graded-assignment-6/169283)
* **GA Platform Changes:** Initially, we were solving questions on [exam.sanand.workers.dev](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev) . However, in GA6, we moved to *Seek* and in GA7, to *Google Forms*. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.

### 2. Project Updates

* **Project 1:** The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.
* **Project 2:** There are multiple doubts posted in the *Project 2* discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved? [(thread link)](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/29)

### 3. ROE Score Update

* While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.

I appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,  
Lakshay

[@carlton](/u/carlton) It’s been over a month, and now an extra day has been taken as well—when will TDS Project 1 finally be released? The delay is getting excessive; some clarity on the timeline would be appreciated.

> **GA Platform Changes:** Initially, we were solving questions on [exam.sanand.workers.dev](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev) . However, in GA6, we moved to *Seek* and in GA7, to *Google Forms*. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.

The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.

With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.

GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.

> **Project 1:** The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.

Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing.

Each and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway.

You got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed.

Thank you for your response [@carlton](/u/carlton) and for addressing our concerns. We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience.

The reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next.

We will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100.

Meanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would be greatly appreciated.  
Looking forward to your response.

Regards,  
Lakshay

Hi [@Sakshi6479](/u/sakshi6479),

You have not followed the instruction in GA4 for the bonus mark.

We were given the list by Anand for all those that followed this instruction.

That is why you have not received the bonus mark for GA4.

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

I would like to share that we have successfully completed **TDS Project 2**, solving **46/57** cases dynamically via **Azure after deployment**! We also tested it with our friends’ **GA questions**, and it’s working as expected.

This project was a **team effort** by me and two friends [ [@lakshaygarg654](/u/lakshaygarg654) and [@23f2004637](/u/23f2004637) ], and we are thrilled with the results post-deployment.

I would love the opportunity to **demonstrate our project** to **TA and Anand Sir** in a **Google Meet session** on **March 31st** (since I have OPPE on the 29th and 30th).

If you can spare some time for a quick look at our project, it would be awesome! Looking forward to your response.

Thank you for the opportunity! However, I won’t be able to present the project in a public session as my **Azure API URL would be exposed**, and since it incurs **costs per usage**, I need to keep it secure.

I’d prefer a **private meet** to demonstrate the project. Please let me know if that can be arranged. Looking forward to discussing it!

Please post any discrepancies related to project1.

[@carlton](/u/carlton)

## Who were evaluated? How did we decide what to evaluate?

All the image ids we evaluated were what *you* submitted to us. This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos *you* gave us.

For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated.

## How to fix bugs in our scripts

Create Pull requests to [Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1](https://github.com/Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1) .

### **Docker Image Architecture Issue Report**

If your Docker image was run on the wrong architecture, please fill out this form:  
[Submit Report](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSerCpqod-5ArJWTW_QW5PenyfZJHH_cmcUw3s8dAoG3zDZm8g/viewform?usp=sharing)

## Bug fixes

If you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix. So it is in your interest to look through our scripts and logs and identify bugs or anomalies. You might just go from 0 to heros.

Kind regards,  
TDS Team

[@carlton](/u/carlton) same issue, My image was also run on a `x86_64` architecture. I too built on my mac which is `ARM` (M1 Processor). I too can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the `exec format error` and **Evaluation log file** is MISSING.

Actually my image was run on x86\_64 architecture as it was present in that log file and because of the wrong architecture it never started.

I also request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.

My evaluation log file is missing.  
The 2 other log files i’m given doesnt have my email inside it listed.  
the Image id which is given in the MAIL is not present in my docker desktop, my project’s docker image is listed in docker desktop, which doesnot matches the image id given in the MAIL,  
What was evaluated? How it was evaluated?

This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: 0ade87d1bf07

My terminal shows 2 images as last, with respective image ids. I am not sure which one is the real, so please check with both the ids.  
tds-project-1 latest c854274f078d 5 weeks ago 1.38GB  
ayush6871/fastapi-agent latest 27e8375b0ab1 6 weeks ago 1.66GB

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir , my Docker image is built on Macbook M1 which as you know uses ARM64 architecture . But evaluated with x86\_64 which caused the exec format error due to cross platform compatibility issues . I am kindly requesting you to re-evaluate the project once again .

I wanted to kindly request if you could review the bonus additional tasks, as they were not reflected in the evaluation, despite being mentioned in the instructions. Apart from that I understand and accept my score overall, especially since I had hardcoded the folder paths in my prompt for some questions, which I believe led to those failures.

* **Bonus: Additional tasks**. We *may* pass additional tasks beyond the list above. If your code handles them correctly, you get 1 bonus mark per task.

Please correct me if I’m wrong, but I noticed that for tasks **B7**, **B8**, and **B10**, the evaluation log does not include any **`POST` or `GET` request traces**, unlike the other tasks which have clearly recorded request flows, generated code, and outputs. In these three cases, the log shows only the failure message without any indication that the script was executed or that the output file was read.

Hi @all

We will identify why arm images created a problem and were run using x86 platform.

We will also rerun evaluations for all the x86 and arm images one more time, before pushing to the dashboard.

It would have run at your end but it was supposed to run at anywhere, after dockerising it didn’t run, reason is taskA module was not found.

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) , [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
It was a good project, and I have obtained the log files. Upon reviewing the log files, I realized that they are unable to read the files. I checked my project on GitHub and discovered that I forgot to uncomment the line that defines the path using the `os` library. As a result, all file evaluations returned errors such as “can’t read the file.”

I understand that this oversight was my mistake. However, is there any way to reevaluate the code by simply uncommenting that line? I believe the rest of the code is properly written, but due to this single comment, all the files remained unchecked or resulted in errors.

I noticed that my Docker image was run on an x86\_64 architecture (as indicated by my email in the shared logs), whereas I originally built it on my Mac (ARM architecture). Due to this mismatch, the image failed to run properly and resulted in an exec format error.

Since there was no prior mention of the architecture on which our images would be evaluated, I request that my evaluation be conducted again on the appropriate machine. Please help as after doing it correctly getting 0 marks because of such an error feels wrong

[@23f2001975](/u/23f2001975) we had to rely on docker telling us whether an image was arm or x86. So thats why we just did what docker software told us. If it classified an image as arm then we ran it on arm. If it did not then we ran it on x86. Thats why we need students to look through the logs and identify issues so that we can make sure you get the correct evaluation.

If students notify us their image is actually arm based, then we will run it on arm. So dont worry, just inform us of any discrepancy as well as bugs. Our evaluation might not be perfect, there may be bugs. If students can precisely create bug reports then we can take that into consideration when evaluating students as well. The benefit being you might get extra marks because of the bug fix.

We have a script that looks at this discourse post each day and tells us who requires a fresh evaluation. So we will check your image on arm.

Kind regards

My image was also run on a `x86_64` architecture. I too built on my mac which is `ARM` (M1 Processor). I too can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the `exec format error` and **Evaluation log file** is MISSING.

Can you please rerun the image on ARM based

We demoed in the live session the complete process of how to dockerise your project so that it can be run anywhere. Running on your local machine is not a sufficient criteria for passing the evaluation. It is absolutely vital for students to understand deployment. This is a critical skill for anyone who is serious about working in this field.

Also just check if yours is an arm based image or x86. Sometimes that makes a difference. For us there is no way to know other than docker software telling us. As it turns out several students had an arm based image but docker did not tell us that. So we will re run those.

If yours has been run on the wrong emulation then we will re run.

I encountered an HTTP 500 error with the following detail:

```
{
"detail": "'choices'"
}

```

This issue appears across all tasks, even though they were running fine before submission. I suspect there might be a problem with APIPROXY\_TOKEN. Could you please look into this?

Additionally, my solution is very similar to the one shared by the System Commands team in their email.

We have given you the evaluation scripts. Identify where exactly you believe the bug is.

Just guesses is not going to get you extra marks. You have to give us something specific.

I encountered the same issue with `evaluate.py`. However, since you previously advised against coding strictly with `evaluate.py`, I didn’t pursue it further. Now, I’m concerned—how is this a mistake?

Yes, I agree.  
So, did my docker ID change when I submitted?  
I am sorry sir, but I did not make any changes after submitting the project, so I guess my Docker ID should remain the same as before, if I am not mistaken. I kindly request you to check just once more please, as I really don’t know where I have went wrong.

Jivraj Sir had checked liked this for another student, so I just wanted to confirm the same for me.  
*" I looked for your response for project1 docker image, and found out that we used correct image id. Here is repo information `harshjaiswal1/tds_project_final latest d0f14a872042 5 weeks ago 214MB` "*

Also sir, could you please tell me why the error as shown in my previous message is being shown? and if there is no chance of it getting correct.

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) !

I am reaching out with deep frustration and concern regarding the evaluation of my project. I have worked tirelessly on this for almost two weeks, dedicating day and night to ensure that the tasks were executed correctly. During my own testing, I was able to get at least 7 out of 10 A tasks working as expected. However, after the evaluation, I was informed that none of the tasks were executed properly, which was quite shocking!

Given the effort and time I have put in, I kindly request you to review my project once more. I am more than willing to demonstrate the functionality in real time to clarify any issues or misunderstandings. Please let me know if there is a possibility to discuss this further, as I genuinely believe my work deserves another review.

```

The error occurs because Python cannot find the `tasksA` module. This is due to the file not existing, not being in the correct directory.

Try running docker container after pulling, check if evaluate.py is able to do it’s job.

Yeah, it’s there on your local machine, but you didn’t copy it to docker container.  
Below is content of your docker file which doesn’t copy tasksA.py file it only copies app.py. You could have figured this out by just running docker container on your local machine earlier, it would have shown you that error.

```
FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates

# Download and install uv
ADD https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh /uv-installer.sh
RUN sh /uv-installer.sh && rm /uv-installer.sh

# Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
RUN pip install fastapi uvicorn

# Ensure the installed binary is on the `PATH`
ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Set up the application directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy application files
COPY app.py /app

# Explicitly set the correct binary path and use `sh -c`
CMD ["/root/.local/bin/uv", "run", "app.py"]

We looked at your script and there are errors in it. It doesn’t follow what we mentioned in live sessions.

Line number 81 of your app.py

`subprocess.run(["uv", "run", script_name, "--root", "./data"] + args, check=True)`

which creates a data directory inside app directory but evaluate.py expects data directory to be in root directory.

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

I’m writing here to express my concerns regarding the evaluation of my TDS Project-1. Also, kindly pardon me for the long message.

I have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday.

These are the detailed point wise concerns :

1. I at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it’s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2½ weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course.
2. By this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn’t receive a reply.
3. I understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them.
4. I also didn’t receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link.

I have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student had dropped the course but the course team didn’t process it) is very unfair.

Kindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written, whichever is feasible, atleast to encourage the efforts and time put into the project with little knowledge.

I hope you would look into my plight, and take necessary measures.

Thanks and Regards

Initially I thought that it can be due to some sending error and i will receive little late but even after 14hrs we have not received anything from the team. How are we supposed to check log and see our mistakes when we didn’t even received marks and logs. I request to check into it and provide us our marks and logs.

Hi [@23f2002400](/u/23f2002400)

Check your Dockerfile if it copies tasksA.py file to docker container.  
If it does where does it copy, these are possible mistakes. You were expected to test docker images.

That’s external port mapping, we mapped your docker’s port 8000 to external 8219 port, so it won’t create issues.

Just look at docker\_orchestration.py file for logic behind it, basically it was for evaluating multiple images parallely.

Sir, my evaluation log file is missing, even though I followed all the steps to generate the Docker image correctly. The system indicates that the server didn’t start within 5 minutes, but when I uploaded it, everything was working fine. I put in a lot of effort into this project, and I’m worried I might receive a zero despite making the submission correctly. Kindly help me resolve this issue. My roll number is 22F3004068.

Additionally, my Docker image ID was **d2f27c03b878**, but the ID mentioned in the email was **dfac8596cd4c**. Please provide clarity on this discrepancy.

I have also attached my Docker [log file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1exrdQOCjbrCFux2hC4OQH_BfgiijCzD1/view?usp=drivesdk) for reference

I realized that I made a mistake in my project by forgetting to uncomment a single line of code: os.path.join(os.getcwd(), “path\_given”). I feel really bad about this oversight, especially after working so hard on the project and formatting everything carefully. It was an honest mistake, and I take full responsibility for it.

I sincerely request you to consider re-evaluating my work, as I believe it reflects the effort and dedication I put into it. I truly regret this error and will be more careful in the Project 2

My log file shows a “file not found” or “directory not found” error. Could you confirm whether `datagen.py` was executed inside the Docker container or on the host OS? If it ran on the host, I don’t see any mounting process for the `/data` folder into the container. Could you please clarify this?

[@carlton](/u/carlton)  
My docker logs shows that `OSError: Cannot find resource` error occurred when the data generation script tried to access font files in generation for a8.  
[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/f/dfc4c289dcc2ddda315bd9f97a9ff21c166792af.png)image1485×807 37.4 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/f/dfc4c289dcc2ddda315bd9f97a9ff21c166792af.png "image")

The datagen.py script looked for Arial font in the try block and when it encountered error it went to the except block to use DejaVuSans, the Pillow default, except it encountered the same error there, which was not handled. Thus, datagen.py stopped abruptly without creating files for A9 and A10 as well. So effectively, my A9 and A10 did not get evaluated properly as it did not have the required files due to error during data generation for A8. Can you please re-evaluate by enclosing each of the data generation function calls in their own try-except blocks?  
[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/6/8/681a3a02c951eaf7014d116d45b9ac35b8fdd2de.png)image302×252 3.45 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/6/8/681a3a02c951eaf7014d116d45b9ac35b8fdd2de.png "image")  
I think it would be better to enclose each of these function calls in their own try-except blocks. This screenshot is taken from the datagen.py file sent in yesterday’s results mail.

So, will it be possible to re-evaluate my task A1, A8, A9 and A10? At least A9 and A10 did not even get the files to work on as they weren’t even created due to insufficient error handling in datagen.py .

Also, can you help me to identify the cause of even the Pillow default font not being available? I don’t understand how a font not being available could be caused by my code.

Thank you

When we build it after pulling it, it will get a unique identifier that makes sure we will only ever evaluate exactly that version. We pull it from your submission in the form.

In other words, if any changes occur to the docker repo, our id will no longer match a newer version of the file. This way we can make sure we are evaluating the right version every time. Your id does not have to match ours.

But we can detect changes made to the docker repo through our image id. I hope that is clear.

We will do some extra sanity checks before the 1/4/2025 just incase there are any issues. But thanks for asking the question.

Kind regards

My logs show, ‘exec format error’ and it is due to architecture issue, image was built on mac.

I have updated the google form regarding the architecture. Please rerun my image. Thanks

Greetings, Sir,

I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between `pandas` and `numpy` caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (`pandas==2.0.3` and `numpy==1.24.3`) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.

To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.

I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (`santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest`). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.

Thank you for your assistance!

Hi,

For Tasks A8, A9 & A10, I am not seeing any errors in my Docker execution logs. I am assuming the evaluation script failed to fetch the output file to verify the output for some reason. Can you please try rerunning these three tasks again? These tasks are working fine for me.

For Task B1. “Data outside /data is never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it.” - So when the evaluation asked to write something to /tmp/hello.txt it has correctly thrown an error saying access denied. I think this should be marked as correct. As the task description itself says so, the return is passed as 200 OK

```
ERROR:main:Error executing write_file: Access denied: /tmp/hello.txt
INFO:     172.17.0.1:60918 - "POST /run?task=Write+%27Hello+World%27+to+%60%2Ftmp%2Fhello.txt%60 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK


```

Similarly for task B2.

```
INFO:main:Checking file path: /data/format.md
ERROR:main:Error executing file_folder_deletion: Deletion not allowed: /data/format.md
INFO:     172.17.0.1:59446 - "POST /run?task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md HTTP/1.1" 200 OK

```

For Task B4, if branch is not given we are assuming it as ‘main’ branch. Is it not correct? We would have at least expected the branch passed in the request.

For Task B8, I could not see the task description sent in the request in evaluation log file. Can you please check if the task request was passed properly?  
Because I see only “=4 B8 failed: not all arguments converted during string formatting” for Task B8

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
Thanks for your encouragement.. tried debugging the issue of image not starting up in the orchestrator script.. I found that the issue was happening because of the http and https proxies being set in docker build

```
ARG http_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.<xxx>.com:80
 ARG https_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.<xxx>.com:80

ENV http_proxy=${http_proxy}
 ENV https_proxy=${https_proxy}

```

This was required as my office environment was behind the proxy and it was required for uv to download the dependencies on startup..

So this had caused the image to run in my office environment and not in orchestrator environment.. now removed the same and tested in a different vm altogether and noticed that the container started up without issues..

Checkin url: [Update Dockerfile removed hard coded proxies · rsjay1976/TDS-Project1-Jan25@a71e3a8 · GitHub](https://github.com/rsjay1976/TDS-Project1-Jan25/commit/a71e3a84b284d7621f2a769308340454ebd58583)

Have pushed the latet image (rsjay1976/tds-project1-jan25:latests) to docker hub as well.. didnt make any source changes or any other changes in the image.. Would be great if this is considered and image be considered for reevaluation… Appreciate your help

Hello sir

I noticed that the log mentioned:  
“python: can’t open file ‘/app/app/main.py’: [Errno 2] No such file or directory.”

However, my main file was named run.py, which might have caused the issue. Since the code was present, I was given a 0. Would it be possible to run it again or consider partial marks for the submission?

Thank you for your time and consideration. I appreciate your help!

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)

I might have found a bug in my code, I have hardcoded my file directory into my code but I didn’t change it later. I have created a safe\_open function that will throw a HTTP\_403\_FORBIDDEN error when tried to access files outside that directory. Because of this all the tasks failed. There also might be environment and configuration issues in my Dockerfile. When I tested locally, it worked fine but because of this small mistake I am now only getting 1/20. Is it possible to change/modify my code?

Thanks for considering, any help would be appreciated. Worked very hard for this

Thanks for your quick response sir. I just wanted to clarify that my dockerfile was recognized by Docker, and my image was successfully built, so it seems that Docker itself didn’t have an issue with the filename.

However, I understand that the evaluation script might be case-sensitive and specifically looking for “Dockerfile” with an uppercase “D”. If that’s the issue, should I rename and push the file again to the repo sir.

Please let me know if that’s the right fix or if I need to do anything else sir.

The image id varies depending on the system it was built on. When we build it on our Xeon cloud compute it will get a different image id from yours (unless you have a Xeon system). What is common is the dcoker hub image name and tag we used. We used the one you submitted on your form.

But the image id serves the same purpose. If you alter the dockerhub image, our image will no longer match the one from dockerhub. the image id sha will change. So do not worry about whether your sha matches our sha. It just acts as a way for us to make sure that we are consistently looking at the same image.

Kind regards

Respected Sir,

I have received a **FAIL** status for the prerequisite check:  
*“Is Docker image present in Docker Hub AND is public.”*

However, as shown in my Docker Hub repository, my Docker images are publicly accessible.

I have attached a screenshot for the reference.

Thank you for your time and support.

Hi [@Jayeshbansal](/u/jayeshbansal) ,

The docker repo name that you submitted through submission form was different than what your screenshot shows. `/jayeshbansal/add9a05689d3` docker repo doesn’t exists or might not be public, that’s why it failed for you.

It depends where you tested it running, if it’s running inside a docker container and you feel there is problem with our script then you can debug our code and create a pull request on repo.

The task B6 was  
<https://quotes.toscrape.com/> has quotes from famous people.  
The .author class has the quote author’s name.  
Extract and save all authors from the first page, in order, to /data/b6.json as an array of strings.  
E.g. `["Douglas Adams", "J.K. Rowling", ...]`

The output in your file is not an array of double quoted strings.

Instead it is an array of an json object with the keyword author and values as an array of authors.

These are two different things. Almost there but not quite.

Kind regards

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) My P1 submission successfully passed all the basic sanity checks on February 15th and obtained a satisfactory score in the P1 evaluation, which was disclosed on March 29th. However, I received a communication today, April 1, stating that my Docker image is not present or public on DockerHub. I kindly request the TDS course team to investigate this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution for students encountering similar issues.

This situation is particularly disheartening—**seeing days of effort and dedication to Project 1 reduced to nothing, especially given the already demanding pace of the course.**

I will appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.

I understand the problem. It may be possible that the image id i gave may be different as i had multiple dockerfile and there is a possibility that i gave the wrong image id due to some confusion. Is it possible for reevaluation. I have worked very hard and I don’t want to lose my marks because of some wrong id misconfusion.

Please consider my request as well, as I do not want to lose marks on a project I have worked hard on, while also helping others. I am expecting a timely and positive response from your end.

Thank you.

Respected Sir,  
I have submitted my project following all the guidelines and fulfilling all the prerequisites. My docker file is available publicly and it is present in the root directory of github repo, still the mail says that the file is missing and my score is zero. Can you please look into this issue

Name of your dockerfile doesn’t match the standard’s.  
It should be `Dockerfile`(with D caps).

Given that you noticed an error on our side, you could have informed us about the same. However, you made your changes 22 hours ago, which is not acceptable.

```
tags = httpx.get(
                f"https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/{username}/{repo}/tags?ordering=last_updated",timeout = 60
            ).json()
            tag, size = next(
                (
                    (tag["name"], tag["full_size"])
                    for tag in tags.get("results", [])
                    if pd.Timestamp(tag["last_updated"]) <= DEADLINE
                ),
                (None, 0),

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Carlton](/u/carlton) I completely understand that changes to the Docker image after the deadline cannot be accepted.

***However, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29.***

[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/9/a/9acc2fc47ea84b9e26c1ed21442ba873d0dca20e.png)image1272×395 25.7 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/9/a/9acc2fc47ea84b9e26c1ed21442ba873d0dca20e.png "image")

But here’s the catch:\*\* Since the problem statement for Project 1 and Project 2 is nearly the same, I took the opportunity to improve upon my Project 1 and use it as the foundation for my Project 2 submission, which I did by:\*

* Implementing a ReAct-based workflow planning & orchestration agent, inspired by the paper [ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629).
* Implementing various tools for web-serping, web-scraping, read-eval-print-loops interpreters for quick calculations, etc.
* Enhancing Shell-use & Python-use by improving upon the existing code interpreter I had implemented for P1. This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything.
* Adding useful API endpoints, including an **`/api/`** multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing **`/read`** and **`/run`** endpoints from Project 1, plus a **`/clear`** endpoint to reset the agent’s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated.
* **Deploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP**, utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI’s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up.

All this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent—it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I’m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like **hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents**, and it would do that for you—without **ever** declining the request. I like to think of it as a **terminal version of** [OpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent](https://openai.com/index/computer-using-agent/).

---

Given all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it’s incredibly discouraging to see my project **naturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates)** and not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate.

## To clarify, **all the updates mentioned above took place after March 29**, **after Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out.** Furthermore, we were **never informed** that a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it.

My only request is that if my **updated P1 submission cannot be evaluated** due to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if my **original P1 eval score could be reinstated** instead of receiving a **0**—since it was already evaluated and graded.

Would highly appreciate your prompt support in this regard [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)

Hi [@thinkmachine](/u/thinkmachine) [@22f3002723](/u/22f3002723)

Since you updated docker repo few days ago and docker api doens’t support timestamp based pulling we will pull your GitHub repo before 18 th feb and will build through it and run evaluations.

We also have your docker repo evaluation score, will discuss which one to keep.

This is for anyone who updated their docker repo and there are around 10-20 such cases

Hi [@thinkmachine](/u/thinkmachine)  
As we said before that changes in Docker image after deadline won’t be accepted. Even an extension of the deadline won’t help in this case, simply because Docker API doesn’t support timestamp based pulling. However we would be pulling your GitHub repositories before 18th Feb build a Docker container and run evaluations on that.

A sigh of relief! Thank you so much for the heads up [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj).

[@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) Yup! The Docker issue is perfectly understandable. Even I checked my Hub repo, and I couldn’t seem to find an image having the pre-18th Feb digest. Had I been aware of this issue, and the fact that a re-eval would be carried out, I would’ve tagged the updated image differently. Hopefully, cases like mine will aid in resolving any issues in the future.

Once again, thank you both!

I have the same issue. I also received a second mail stating I had failed due to some missing prerequisites though in the first mail my project evaluation had been carried out.

Hi [@lakshaygarg654](/u/lakshaygarg654)

Dont worry you passed pre-requsites. The script that was used earlier for basic checks used a stricter criteria, the newer one we wrote allowed for a looser check. You have scored very well in your latest run. 12 correct tasks.

We have not responded quickly because we are in the midst of finalising all the scores and doing normalisation etc, i.e operational work for Project 1 and 2.

We hope to have Project 2 scores out by this weekend.

Kind regards

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Sir can you also see the case of Dockerfile name. Many students have named it dockerfile , lower case ‘d’ character instead of upper case.  
Please sir see through it

Thanks [@carlton](/u/carlton) , for your response.

I was never worried about the result, whether it comes late or early. I know you will release it once everything is processed correctly. My concern was only about getting a response. Anyway, thanks for replying.

Also, today’s session has been canceled. I wanted to ask about the issue with editing responses in the Project 2 form. Is there any update on this?

Hi just wanted to know, there was no mail prior stating to keep the Dockerfile in the root folder of the repo (correct me if im wrong). Therefore i have put everything inside a folder - wont this be considered? Please clarify if possible.

You have to show which task triggered this error. Is it all of them or only one of them. Only then we can diagnose what the problem is.

Here it is with the task, however the error doesn’t seem to be related to the task itself based on the returned message in the JSON. It seems to be something wrong with the OpenAI API key. From the reading I did, it seems that the key was perhaps not set properly during evaluation? Not completely sure but please look into it.

We have communicated it in the live sessions. It was also communicated via an email when students failed first prerequisite check pass back in February 16th. At that time we gave students a time window to fix it.

We discussed it internally with [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) and he stated that it is standard industry practise to put Dockerfile in the root folder of a github and he expects students to do it **regardless of whether we explicitly mentioned it or not** on the project 1 page. The reason being, any Docker image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build). Since root is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is standard industry practise.

In our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile inside the github and it was vetoed by [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)

So unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not be able to evaluate your docker image.

Kind regards,  
TDS team

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir, I would like to respectfully ask if this is some sort of April Fool’s joke, as it appears that the TDS team is still only verifying the presence of files in the git repository and checking the accessibility of the repository. I fully understand the importance of marks and the effort we put into Project 1. That’s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0 Score.

I am not the only one facing this issue; several others have encountered the same problem. I kindly request you to review my submission again.

Additionally, I have faced multiple technical issues in recent times. Initially, I was failed in the L1 viva due to a typing mistake, which was later acknowledged. Similarly, in both OPPE 1 and OPPE 2, many students experienced Google Meet issues. On March 29, during my SC OPPE, I faced camera issues in Google Meet, along with VM lagging. Many students have raised similar concerns with Proctor.

Given this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation. I sincerely request you to re-evaluate my submission.

Thanks for the quick reply, i don’t have a convincing argument to counter. Just a suggestion it would have been better if you have explicitly put in the sanity check requirements. Something so obvious to you might not be so for others.  
if you are referring to this email even here, it was not explicit. Might have missed it in the gmeet. A mail would have been good.

If you used openai’s python module then you were needed to pass your own api key, hardcode it in code.

API key that we were sending was only valid through proxy server created by professor anand.

We are rebuilding all docker submissions from github commit before 18th of Feb, using your Dockerfile manifest present in the repo.

That way there is no architecture issues.

Its part of our secondary check. And more students have gotten scores in this check. So dont worry.

Sir,  
In the mail that i got about project 1 report. In the log file it was written as TasksA.py file not found in docker, which was the case i observed with many students.

This is my Github repo:

I built the image using docker build command in vs code terminal. And pushed it same way to dockerhub using docker push command. How is it possible that the docker container missed the TasksA.py file while building or pushing it?

After getting this mail, I ran the project locally again mutliple times just to check if there was any issues in the code. It was getting 9/10 test cases passed.

You only copied `app.py` into your docker image.

How do you expect your application to run without the other files that your repo clearly shows is needed?

Thats why many people are failing this. Hope the image makes this clear.

[@thinkmachine](/u/thinkmachine)

Firstly, you have passed evaluation and got a decent score (on a more lenient script that we used for everyone.) The email was sent by a script that used a more stricter evaluation (which understandably caused some stress). So you can breathe a sigh of relief. ![:slight_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/slight_smile.png?v=14 ":slight_smile:")

*However* with regards to your long post…

Let me tell you a true story. I personally know a *very* experienced senior engineer at a top defense contractor for the US, here is some pearls of wisdom from him.

What you have done is what is called in industry as **gold plating**. Its a cardinal sin in software engineering. NEVER gold plate. ALWAYS build to spec.

In fact its a good reason to fire an engineer. Why?

1. Because it does not deliver what was required,
2. Wastes valuable time and resources
3. Increases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!)
4. Complicates testing
5. Leads to scope creep

His advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate.

I hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance and make you stand out.

For personal hobbies this does not apply. But for a client (including us) if you fail to deliver the minimum spec then we cannot grant you an evaluation (by the way this post is not targetted specifically for you, it just felt like an appropriate place to explain this).

Kindest regards

Hi Sir,  
I just realized that I mistakenly submitted the image tag “abhay227/version1” instead of the correct image ID. The correct image ID is **4db729a03f74** , which is part of version1 that is already present and publicly available.  
I have worked very hard on this project, and I am concerned that due to this error, my whole effort may be wasted. Unfortunately, I did not receive any notification regarding an invalid submission after I submitted the Project1 form, and I only recently became aware of this mistake. I kindly request you please consider this correct image ID.

Thank you for your understanding and assistance. I look forward to your positive response.

Hi Abhay,

This was a basic error. Unfortunately for basic errors we are not able to relax the requirements. All students were given a clear directive on what the minimum requirements were in order to be evaluated. Failure to follow those clear instructions prevents us from making any exceptions, because then we just have to dump all those requirements for all students and that would not be fair to those that took the care to be careful about their submissions.

Kind regards

Thanks for the clarification regarding the evaluation, [@carlton](/u/carlton). It’s a relief to know that my original submission was successfully evaluated. Had I known that the stricter evaluation script would pull the image matching the digest from the time of submission (which had been overwritten by April 1), I would’ve used a separate tag to avoid the issue altogether.

Regarding your point on gold plating — I completely understand and have come to appreciate the importance of building to spec from personal experience, especially in production or client-facing settings where fixed targets, maintainability, and minimal scope creep are key. That said, with TDS projects, my goal was purely exploratory — to explore the boundaries of what’s possible **within the scope of the problem statement**.

What began as just another (pun intended) *tedious* assignment slowly evolved into a hobbyist research project on LLM agents. ![:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes.png?v=14 ":grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:")

*(…caution: long post ahead ![:sweat_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/sweat_smile.png?v=14 ":sweat_smile:"))*

I noticed that **test cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often overlapping on Python & Shell use**. While it would’ve been easy to hardcode 50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots + hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering the **inherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads**. No two payloads are exactly alike — even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably. There’s also really no way to predict an edge case caused by an LLM.

Some might suggest using `temperature=0` to get more deterministic LLM behavior — and while true to an extent, it does little to encourage exploration, especially in tasks that require self-correction based on environmental feedback. Prompt engineering too wouldn’t be helpful here as 4o-mini isn’t all that great at 0-shot instruction following, especially when the system prompt is already saturated with 50+ fine-grained instructions. There’s only so much stuff it can pay attention to.

**Hardcoded tool agents also aren’t really “agents” in my view— they’re more like passive AI powered regex matchers**: merely mapping inputs to functions by inferring from context window. That puts all the burden of answering on the hardcoded functions, leaving the agent itself uninvolved in the solutioning process. If they break, the agent will never try to ‘fix’ them and keep calling them like a broken record.

At the core of it, it’s all about **how much flexibility vs rigidity** we give to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between — The right solution would naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio.

Since most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to,

* Reason about the task, understand intent,
* Reflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e. *design* a DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else)
* Execute those workflows (*walk* the DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed.
* Observe the final result, and repeat if needed.

Interestingly, a similar framework was suggested in [this ICLR 2022 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629). That was all the validation I needed to know I was stepping in the right direction.

To make environment interaction possible, the agent didn’t need dozens of narrow tools — just a small, well-defined set of **general-purpose tools**:

* A REPL executor (for quick calcs)
* A Python script runner
* A Shell executor

With just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally — avoiding overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors. Potentially allowing for full fledged Computer-Use via shell and so much more.

As for the fact that it ended up being capable of things beyond the scope of Project 1 (like training & tuning ML models autonomously, reporting results etc.) — that was **emergent behavior**, not deliberate gold plating. It was a pleasant surprise even to me. I’ve yet to discover more of such interesting hidden use cases. While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration and research. *Frankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff!*

I am actually very thankful to the TDS course team & [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) for devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with. **Food for thought! Really!**

As for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I’ll be experimenting with— modalities.

PS: I’m not claiming it’s perfect or production-ready, or it should score a perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these projects: **thoughtful use of LLMs in agent design**. At this point, I’m less concerned about the marks, I’m actually enjoying the thought joyride. ![:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes.png?v=14 ":grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:")

---

**TL;DR**  
My approach doesn’t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback and iterates — much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework. I’ve only just wired the pieces together.

Request for Clarification on Zero Marks Given – Repository Was Public with All Required Files

Dear [@Carlton](/u/carlton) sir  
I wanted to kindly request a clarification regarding the evaluation of my project submission. I noticed that I have been awarded zero marks, and I’m a bit confused because I had made sure that everything was in place.

* My GitHub repository was **public** at the time of submission.
* I had included the **Dockerfile** as required.
* I also added the **MIT License** to the project.
* For your reference, I am also attaching a **snapshot** of the repository as it was during the submission time.

Given all these were in place, I would really appreciate it if you could provide a **concrete reason** for giving **zero marks**. I’m eager to understand what went wrong so I can avoid it in the future and improve myself. But u saying in email that my repo was not public , not having dockerfile and not having mit licsence .

Hi sir  
I noticed a discrepancy in my Project 1 results. In the initial results shared on March 29th, I had received 8/20 based on the evaluation logs. However, the final result I received today states that none of the tasks in Task A and B were working, and I was awarded only 1 bonus mark.

During my own testing, I was consistently getting 7/10 correct in Task A, so I’m a bit confused about the change.  
Kindly request you to look into this discrepancy sir

Dear [@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir,  
I’ve noticed discrepancies in my Project 1 results. During the tests I ran before submitting, I consistently got about 7/10 in Task A. In the results shared earlier, I was informed that my evaluation log file was missing. Later, a Gform regarding the architecture was sent, which I filled and submitted. Now, the final result I received today, shows that the taskA module is missing and I’ve been given a bonus of 1 mark.  
I kindly request you to look into the matter and provide an explanation and solution in this regard.

Respected Sir,

I hope you’re all doing well. I’m writing regarding my Project 1 evaluation, as I’ve encountered a discrepancy that I’d like some help with.

According to the evaluation email I received, my score was 0 for all the tasks with an additional bonus of 1 (totaling a P1 score of 1). However, when I ran the provided evaluation script before my submission, I got 7 in Phase A. Additionally, after reviewing the Docker logs, evaluation logs, and the p1\_evaluation\_error\_logs (from the linked Google Sheets), I couldn’t find any reference to my roll number.

Could someone please help me investigate this issue? I’d really appreciate any guidance from the evaluation team.

Thank you for your time and assistance!

I had spent hours finishing my project and this i am sure my marks are not on par with the desired work i did  
Look into this matter as it signifies if i will be able yo pass tds in this term or not.

To replicate the test environment:

Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can run this code using uv.

```
# /// script
# dependencies = [
#   "requests",
# ]
# ///

import requests
import datetime as dt
import zoneinfo
import argparse
import os
import zipfile

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser (description="Fetch the latest commit before a given deadline.")
parser.add_argument (
    "--owner",
    type=str,

repo = args.repo
save_path = args.save
extract_path = args.extract

deadline = dt.datetime (2025, 2, 18, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo("Asia/Kolkata"))
deadline_str = deadline.isoformat ()

github_headers = {
    "Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3+json",

try:
    response = requests.get (url, headers=github_headers, timeout=60)
    response.raise_for_status ()  # Raise an error for bad responses

    # Get the sha
    commits = response.json ()
    if commits:

        # Create the directory if it doesn't exist
        os.makedirs (save_path, exist_ok=True)

        with open (save_path + zip_filename, "wb") as f:
            f.write (zip_response.content)
        print (f"Downloaded zip file: {zip_filename}")

        # Create the directory if it doesn't exist
        os.makedirs (extract_path, exist_ok=True)

        # Extract the zip file
        with zipfile.ZipFile (extract_path + zip_filename, "r") as zip_ref:
            zip_ref.extractall (extract_path)
        print (f"Extracted zip file to: {extract_path}")

    else:
        print (f"No commits found before {deadline_str}")

except:
    print(f"Error fetching commits: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")

```

Pass the required arguments to the above application and it will find the latest commit before the 18th, fetch it and unzip it to the folder you specified. Please use the appropriate arguments as specified in the application.

`docker build -t <your image name> .`

Run new docker image using  
`docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 <your image name>`

Keep datagen.py and evaluate.py in same folder  
`uv run evaluate.py --email <any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000`

This then re-produces the exact environment how your application was tested.  
You have to provide a token from your environment for testing.

These instructions are same for everyone. So check first before posting here.

That is what is being tested, not that it ran on your machine (unless you replicate the test environment exactly).

Your repo is not public! Thats why we cannot see any other files either. If its not public we cannot see if other files exist. We cannot evaluate an invisible repo.

**Things i have done for my project to work locally:**

> `git clone <your repo url>`

cloned my repo which looked like this after cloning(ignore those green dots)  
[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/1/517fe247c71c06f80741f22983662ba012749382.png)image274×118 2.87 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/1/517fe247c71c06f80741f22983662ba012749382.png "image")

All the files are in this folder (I wasn’t aware that we cannot have the subfolder in the root directory,I shouldn’t get penalized for this) and added the datagen and evaluate.py file.

when i do this( ![:down_arrow:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/down_arrow.png?v=14 ":down_arrow:")) i get this error

Instead,in order to run the docker image successfully we have to do either of the two things(taken help from chatgpt ![:upside_down_face:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/upside_down_face.png?v=14 ":upside_down_face:")):  
1)

```
Use full path (recommended if you're outside the project folder):

docker build -t tushar2k5/tds-project-1 D:\TDS_Project_1\tds-project-1

```

**OR**  
2)

```
Add a dot (.) at the end to specify the current directory as the build context:

docker build -t tushar2k5/tds-project-1 .

```

*Both the things work for me*(![:up_arrow:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/up_arrow.png?v=14 ":up_arrow:"))

docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=i.am.still.noob.inTDS -p 8000:8000 tushar2k5/tds-project-1

Done this(can’t leak my token,already many students stolen it from my project-2🤦‍♂️)

Dockerfile has to be inside root of any github repo, this is standard and we had discussion with Professor Anand about such cases where it’s not part of root directory, he suggested we will consider only Dockerfile being present in root folder of the repo.

Sorry but its not possible to attend every single session and you guys haven’t informed us via email so how its our fault.For cases like this you guys should allow us to move our files to the root directory so it can work…(we just have to move files in the repo please consider it)[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)

Please do consider allowing us to change the position of the dockerfile to the root. We are doing nothing but changing its location in the repo. This was not mentioned anywhere in the prerequisites before the submission and it is unfair to not consider all our work for a criteria that was nowhere mentioned in the course page before the submissions. It may be standard practice but a lot of us were unaware. Please do consider this request.

This basically tells you didn’t validate docker Dockerfile and docker image by building and running them, otherwise you would have corrected the mistake.

Hi, I work in the IT industry. There is no standard like “docker file has to be only in the root folder.”

If at all you are setting a requirement why was this not mentioned in the project page?

We were asked to build an app which solves the given tasks. You were OK for whatever code/tools/method to use as long as it works, there the “industry standard” didn’t show up ironically!!!

Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in.

In the same industry that I work - we build the dockers and give it for prod push.

I debugged that I had a small issue in the dockerfile that was submitted and it is  
CMD [“/root/.local/bin/uv”, “run”, “app.py”] has an **invisible Unicode non-breaking space** (`U+00A0`) between `"run", "app.py"` instead of a regular space. This causes the shell to misread the command.  
I know it’s very late for the submission to reconsider, but this small mistake spoiled my hard earned project which got local score 8/25 which could finally get converted to 12 marks. I made this change and pushed it to docker and github repository. Considering this, I request you to please evaluate my submission if possible, because I don’t want to lose the marks which i tried my level best to score. I already have good score in GA’s and ROE. Expecting a positive response from your end.

Sir, I realized that I mistakenly submitted the image tag `"abhay227/version1"` instead of the correct image ID. The correct image ID is `4db729a03f74`, which is part of version1 and is already present and publicly available.  
Unfortunately, I didn’t receive any notification about this issue after submission. Receiving this mail at this stage feels disheartening after all the effort I’ve put into the project. I kindly request you please consider this correct image ID.

Hi, all my pre-requisites have been fulfilled, and the evaluation logs say I have a score of 10/25. But I have gotten a score of 0, saying ‘Task A module missing’. This is a kind request to confirm the scores.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) and [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) , for Task A i had tested before and all the test cases passed, but all my A tasks has failed with 0, In the evaluation logs, i could see that all task A tests failed due to datagen.py not available.

Could you rerun the test ?

Respected Sir,

Thank you for your response and for providing the steps to replicate the test environment.  
Steps Taken to Replicate the Test Environment  
I cloned my repository using:

```
bash
git clone <my_repo_url>
cd <my_repo_directory>
I built the Docker image using:

bash
docker build -t.
I ran the Docker container with:

bash
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000

I ensured that datagen.py and evaluate.py were placed in the same folder as instructed.

Finally, I ran the evaluation script using:

bash
uvicorn evaluate.py --email=<any_email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000

```

Issue with Original Submission  
After reviewing the evaluation logs, I identified that the issue with my original submission was caused by binary incompatibility between pandas (version 2.0.3) and NumPy (version 1.24.3). These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally.

However, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail.  
I acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message.

Action Taken  
To address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected:

The application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes.

It responds to requests within the required timeframe.

I have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository:  
Docker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest

Request for Re-Evaluation  
I kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly.

Previous Message for Reference  
For your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail:

"Greetings, Sir,

I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.

To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.

I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.

Thank you for your assistance!"

There are no evaluation logs for you, I am not sure which evaluation log you are referring to. Your docker image fails to run the required task because your Dockerfile is misconfigured. Did you follow the test environment setup mentioned in this post before posting your query?

Because if you did, you will realise why your evaluation failed.  
You must replicate the test environment and then if you submission works, you have a legitimate appeal. Otherwise we will not consider it. Please replicate the issue using the test environment as detailed in the post link.

You can take it up with [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)  
I did not come up with the standard.  
And it is a standard practise to have build configurations at root of a project otherwise no one will know where to search for the configuration files.

> Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in.

Its not difficult to code to search for it, we are not idiots. It was one of the adjustments we considered and asked Anand if we could make the allowance. He made the decision to enforce this protocol.

Kindest regards.

Respected Sir,  
see the above image its from the scores we got from mail just before the latest one, in that I had got 7/20 and now new mail shows I got 0?? how is this possible…  
the link for evaluation in which i got 7/20 is : [23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\_evaluation.log - Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cNVy9KSfSITZg_KGLF2_wwLWjzNl8mb5/view)

MOST importantly mail shows :  
**Your final t score** calculation is based on

MIN (20, (task score + bonus))

**Github repo submitted:** [GitHub - 23f2001390/llmagent](https://github.com/23f2001390/llmagent)

**Docker repo submitted:** 23f2001390/llmagent

**Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)**

Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1

Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1

Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1

Gihub repo check - Dockerfile exists: 1  
Your task score is: 0  
Your bonus is: 1  
Your P1 score is: 1

So according to the above, I passed the pre-requisites and also in mail u have mentioned that:  
We have attached the docker logs and the evaluation logs for everyone who passed the pre-requisites.

but I don’t find my mail id or roll number in the docker\_logs.zip or evaluation\_logs.zip that has been given in the mail(latest), if I passed the pre requisites my logs should be there in the zip files included in this latest mail right, my roll number is 23f2001390 and email id is 23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in  
and nor do i find my id in the p1\_evaluation\_error\_logs so please help sir

If you tried you would find that it will not build. Thats why you have no logs.  
90 such cases are there where the image could not be built from your repo.

The specific error in your case is:  
tried copying requirements.txt which doesn’t exists

Thats why there are no logs.

What I observed is that most of the repositories appear to be copied from a single source. This original repository contains several issues, such as an incorrectly named Dockerfile and missing instructions to copy all necessary data. Unfortunately, many students seem to have uploaded it blindly without reviewing or fixing these problems.

Most common reason for during running docker image was `taskA module was missing` which is because a lot of students blindly copied from someone with building and running image, if they would have done that they could have corrected it at early stage.

Sir actually my project doesn’t have requirements.txt, instead it installs automatically  
when:  
`uv run app.py` is run and for docker image it installs while building and I had submitted the docker image with all libraries required(the dockerfile below, in that it installs while building).  
my dockerfile from the repo:

```
FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates

# Download and install uv
ADD https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh /uv-installer.sh
RUN sh /uv-installer.sh && rm /uv-installer.sh

# Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
RUN pip install fastapi uvicorn requests python-dateutil pandas db-sqlite3 scipy pybase64 python-dotenv httpx markdown duckdb faker pillow

# Ensure the installed binary is on the `PATH`
ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Set up the application directory
WORKDIR /app
# Copy application files
COPY *.py /app/
COPY .env /app/

# Explicitly set the correct binary path and use `sh -c`
CMD ["/root/.local/bin/uv", "run", "app.py"]

```

here u can see it installs using pip install …

here it’s requiring `.env` file to be present in the project folder because my project when I was uploading to both git and docker had `.env` file for AIPROXY\_TOKEN and I uploaded to docker with that `.env` file but as git doesn’t allow upload of `.env` file I couldn’t upload`.env` to git

the project will still work after downloading the repository when we upload AIPROXY\_TOKEN as environment variable but to again build the docker image for replicating the test environment, my docker image could not be built because`.env` file doesn’t upload to GIT, so when I downloaded the repository from the above method, it didn’t have the `.env` file so it didn’t build so I had to create the `.env` file now to create the docker image, and for the dockerimage I had submitted, I built it with the `.env` file(it supports both`.env` file and environment variable one)

But sir, just because the repository doesn’t have .env file it couldn’t build the dockerimage, the docker image will build in any test environment as u said but it requires the .env to be included which the git didn’t have(it doesn’t allow upload of it ofcourse), don’t rerun the evaluation again but please sir atleast give me those 7/20 marks along with the pre-requisite bonus(1mark) that was mailed earlier to me along with logs…this is my primary degree after 12th, I’m also not asking any extra marks just the marks that i got earlier:

I don’t know reason behind it, earlier evaluation was done by pulling docker image.  
Latest one was done through github repo, if code in github repo is not consistent with docker image it might cause problems.

LLM won’t provide same results every time, for that reason we have give bonus marks.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir it is my humble request to do something. We are losing our marks because of small negligence or mistakes like i fogot to commit my requirements.txt in my github repository. Already the course has taken tolls on our mind. Please give partial marks for the correct run of the docker image or please evaluate my latest commit with the requirements.txt. Because of this project I will lose my cgpa and the hardwork that I have done till this term. A small mistake is causing me my full marks and grades. Atleast consider partial marking for the docker image which does the tasks. I have maintained 9+ cgpa in the diploma and I took other subjects which are easy this term like BDM still is really difficult to cope with the subject. Please consider something. atleast give 50% of the marks for each task which my image passes.

I also used same docker image which i have given you through form. Its my humble request please consider or give some solution. It felt like betrayal because we put effort’s.

Dear Sir,  
I understand that this request is coming at a late stage, and I truly apologize for the timing. However, I felt it was important to express how much effort and dedication I have invested in this project and throughout the course. The recent issue has been disheartening for me, especially because the work I submitted was not a blind copy from someone else.

Had it been otherwise, I wouldn’t have had the courage to reach out. I genuinely care about this course and the learning it offers, and I’m proud of the commitment I’ve shown so far.

With utmost respect, I kindly request you to reconsider evaluating my project again, if there’s any possible way to do so. It would mean a lot to me and would really motivate me to keep pushing forward in this subject.

Hi [@23f1001524](/u/23f1001524) [@afsalshah](/u/afsalshah) [@23f1000879](/u/23f1000879) [@23f1002056](/u/23f1002056)

I understand your situation. We discussed all these scenarios in our weekly meets, and it was decided that we cannot make allowances for these because there was ample time to test your deployments and also ample sessions were conducted to address any difficulties you might have faced. A basic minimum standard was expected and we are unable to relax that threshold because then it would make evaluations meaningless.

We are not just evaluating on your agent functions. We require deployability as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause a critical failure.

**A minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things from working.**

**Critical failures prevents everything else from working** and thus most of these what seems like minor failures are missclassified. They are in fact critical failures.

I know its not of much comfort right now, but the learnings from this will be important going forward in your career.

Kindest regards

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand),

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to humbly request a reconsideration regarding the evaluation of my project submission.

I understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I’m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn’t going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night.

I do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students—including myself—it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation.

I sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I’ve worked hard to demonstrate.

I know you all have our best interests in mind, and I’m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties—especially for a single oversight—can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities. I hope my request can be considered with empathy.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sir, I sincerely apologize for the mistake I made in naming the LICENSE file as “LIcense” instead of “LICENSE”. I now understand how important these details are, and it was an unintentional oversight on my part. I had put in a lot of hard work into the project, and it would mean a lot to me if you could kindly consider evaluating it, even though the deadline has passed and results are out. I completely understand if it’s not possible, but I just wanted to request a chance as this project was very important to me and I genuinely learned a lot from it.

Yes,the Same case happend to me also we have put lot of efforts in this project but after seeing that in mail you have no mit licence, I added that license but with name of mit license actually to just name that license file as MIT license but due to this all our hardwork is just an experience but actually we are not awarding any marks in project1 . I request the TDS team to consider this issue.

I think the mistake would have been because in my repo the file name is “dockerfile” and you have mentioned it as “Dockerfile” . So is it a mistake to put “D” in lowercase.  
Kindly look into this sir because of this I got 0 in project 1 even though many of the tasks of my projects passed the evaluation test.

For dockerfile you have in repo, It was named differently, correct naming has to be Dockerfile.

Dear [@carlton](/u/carlton)

This is Senthur. I have reviewed the logs, and it indicates that the  
`/app/app/main.py` file is missing. However, in my project directory, the  
`main.py` file is located in the `app/` folder, and the `run.py` file is in the root folder of the project, which is `LLM_Automation_Agent` . This structure allows the `run.py` file to run the project without any issues by calling the appropriate functions from `app/main.py`.

To run the project, the command I used is:

```
python run.py

```

Since `run.py` is placed in the root folder and not in any subfolder, it should properly execute the project without any errors, as it redirects the calls to `app/main.py`.

I believe the evaluation may have been incorrect because the project was not executed in the way it was intended. I kindly request you to re-run the project using the `run.py` script located in the root folder (`llm-automation-agent`).

For your reference, I have attached screenshots from my local machine where the project was tested successfully, along with my GitHub screenshot.

Here is the GitHub link to my project:

This `npx` error is originating from your Docker container—it’s not being generated by our script. Try to look for what caused this error.

My code uses `npx` to format Markdown files using Prettier, specifically via `subprocess.run(["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--write", ...])`, which assumes that `npx` is available in the environment. However, since the Docker container is based on Linux and I didn’t explicitly install Node.js or `npx`, this results in an error during evaluation.

To test the functionality correctly, `npx` must be installed inside the running container. This can be fixed by entering the container and installing Node.js and npm using:

bash: `apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm`

Once installed, `npx prettier@3.4.2` should work as expected.

For reference, this approach worked perfectly when I tested the same task locally on my Windows 11 system, where `npx` is available by default.

idk why i am doing this but this is my last request (for evaluation) with proofs. me and my friend both have same docker file code with missing flask dependency (i will try as much to not reveal his id/name) he got 12/20 even tough i tried same methods given by you and same error popped up flask module not found in his case but you gave him 12/20 marks but for me you gave 0? did i done something wrong? I know in industry level it matters much but right now we are students and for us CGPA matters. i am also uploading his docker file image and mine with 0 commits after 18th feb.

Dear Sirs,  
[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

As per the Project 1 deliverables, I had submitted my Docker Hub repo, that hosted the Docker image. At the time of submission, the image was running smoothly, was fully accessible, and was successfully handling the API calls as intended.

[![Screenshot 2025-04-07 233513](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/7/b/7b8a704d618edd74036a95649a83054e29932879.png)Screenshot 2025-04-07 233513805×197 9.52 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/7/b/7b8a704d618edd74036a95649a83054e29932879.png "Screenshot 2025-04-07 233513")

**Github repo submitted:** [GitHub - wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent](https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent)  
**Docker repo submitted:** wasimansariiitm/my-ai-agent

The previous evaluation was successfully conducted using my Docker image, which was responding as expected. However, during the subsequent evaluation, the image was rebuilt using my GitHub repo link, and unfortunately, the `app.py` file could not be found. As a result, my evaluation logs are missing from the evaluation logs bundle.

I would like to respectfully bring this to your kind attention that the `app.py` file does exist in the repository, but it is located inside a subfolder:  
[https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/app/app.py](https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/blob/main/app/app.py).  
But as per the submission instructions, I provided the GitHub repo link only: <https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent>.

Humbly stating, I did not anticipate that the image will be rebuilt from the GitHub repo at a later stage due to some unforeseen circumstances. Had I known this, I would have made sure the project repo was structured appropriately to support that scenario. To be noted, that the earlier evaluation ran smoothly, and the app responded to all queries as expected.

I’m unsure what to expect now or request, but I just wanted to bring this issue to your notice. Even if I manage to get a single answer correct upon a successful evaluation, it would mean a lot to me and contribute meaningfully to my overall score. I would be extremely grateful if you could look into my case and extend your support in this matter.

Thank You and Regards,

24ds3000090

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Sir, in my docker logs, the datagen script encounters error during creating the credit card image for A8 during which it fails to find both the fonts used in the try and except blocks, resulting in the datagen script to stop abruptly without creating the files for A8 to A10.

[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/4/a49f182e22015df35039be85cdd26ad71a07f7a3.png)image1298×857 29.4 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/4/a49f182e22015df35039be85cdd26ad71a07f7a3.png "image")

I actually want to know if this could have been avoided by some changes in my code or is it an issue in the datagen.py script, because as the situation currently stands, my app wasn’t even tested properly for tasks A8 to A10 as the datagen.py script failed to create the required files because it could not find a font which as far as I knew was not specified that it must be included in my own code or image somehow.

Edit 1: I just realized that the datagen script looked for the fonts in python 3.13/site-packages/…  
But my docker image is using the python:3.12-slim-bookworm. Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements.

Edit 2:  
Even if the font not being available is somehow my fault, A9 and A10 still should not be penalized for A8 without proper checking.  
[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/f/5f99c9908823f381a7756ba6fe89d4827ca2faf4.png)image1027×510 11 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/f/5f99c9908823f381a7756ba6fe89d4827ca2faf4.png "image")  
Though an error occured in A8, A9 and A10 still could have worked if each of these function calls were enclosed in their own try-except blocks, ensuring independent checks for each task. But the current datagen.py script fails as error propagates to main, where it is not handled and causes abnormal termination without executing the functions for creating files for A9 and A10 as well.

Thank you.  
Regards,  
Shivaditya

Hi Haricharan

Your Dockerfile does not build the repo. Its misconfigured.  
This is the error when building it:

```

This is because if you look at your Dockerfile .env does not exist in your repo.  
Therefore it does not build.  
Your docker is supposed to take the AIPROXY token from our environment not from yours.  
This is passed dynamically at runtime of the Docker.

Since it fails to build, we cannot evaluate it.

Kind regards

Your container failed to run after building it.

```
docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: error during container init: exec: "uv": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown

Thats why we cannot evaluate it.

There is **clearly** *some difference* between both the applications. That is up to you to figure out. I can only tell whats wrong with yours. After building it and trying to run it this is the error we get. It fails to run as a result and we cannot evaluate it.

We used some internal parameters with weights to auto calculate the bonus. Unless your submission met that threshold of 0.5 after scaling you would not get any bonus. Your score was normalised so instead of 3 you got 4 (3.75 got rounded up). But the metrics used to evaluate the quality of your submission only scored you at 0.007 which is far below the threshold required to get a bonus.

Respected Sir,

* Yes Sir, I said the same, `.env` was not able to be uploaded to repo as .env file was not allowed to be uploaded
* when we download the repository it doesn’t have the `.env` file,
* for docker image to build we need to add `.env` with `AIPROXY_TOKEN`
* after that docker image will build, I had given about this in previous message
* As you said Sir that you will use separate `AIPROXY_TOKEN`…you can put that in `.env` file and build the docker image
* after that Sir its optional to pass `AIPROXY_TOKEN` again while running the docker Image
* just the `.env` file required, even without token in that it will work as project has support for both AIPROXY token in .env file and as environment variable

and when I uploaded to repository the .env file was not allowed to upload so had submitted that way, I actually forgot to add step for running the docker image in the previous message, the steps which I used:

```
git clone https://github.com/23f2001390/llmagent.git

```

adding `.env` with AIPROXY token and replacing `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` with new ones according to test environment

```
docker build -t llm-agent .

```

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 llm-agent
or
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=token -p 8000:8000 llm-agent

```

and in another terminal

```
uv run evaluate.py --email=23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000

```

Thank you

I understand it’s my mistake sir and I apologize for that sir, but please consider this time sir since because of this my entire project score went from 9/20 to 0, which would make me difficult to pass this course and continue my diploma.  
Please consider this request sir, sorry sir and this would never be repeated in future. My project evaluation was 9/20 initially sir, but later it came down to 0 because of this issue. Kindly consider sir please.

I tested the docker file in docker playground again.. Please find the screenshot of the docker build command and the log output of the docker build.. It went thru without issues..

Was the latest docker file used from git lab? Because as explained on March 30 i had to remove the hardcoded http/https proxies of my office environment,

Thanks [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
As mentioned earlier, the pre Feb 18 dockerFile commited in GIT had my office proxy url’s set as http\_proxy and https\_proxy.. It worked in my office envuironment and i tested everything in my office environment but based on the results which came on March last week realised that the proxies were preventing the uv to be installed in other environments.

Post that realised we have cloud based "docker playground’ utility where docker builds can be tested agonistic of any environment.. The good thing with playground is our instances last for only 3 hrs and next day we try we are kind of gauranteed of fresh environment without any caches,

Now after March 30th checkin validated the same in docker playground and ensured that the image got tagged and createdd successfully..

It would be great if the March 30th checkin could be considered, Again appreciate all your help so far.

**Subject:** Request for Verification of Dockerfile and Reevaluation of Marks for Project 1  
[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Sir,  
Regarding the recent feedback on **Project 1** for **TDS**, it was mentioned that there is no Dockerfile in my GitHub repo. However, the Dockerfile is named **`dockerfile`** (not **`Dockerfile`**). Please verify the repository again with this in mind.

Additionally, my Docker image architecture is *linux/amd64* (64-bit **x86**). I have also filled out the **Architecture Information Collector** form as requested.

**Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)**  
Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1  
Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1  
Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1  
Gihub repo check - Dockerfile exists: 0

I’ve got good news for you and 30 other students. Thanks to your diligent debugging effort that we were able to find this bug. For now the fix is that we will not evaluate you on a8 and catch the datagen exception so as to not cause cascading failures.

Thanks and kind regards.  
We will let you know the outcome of the evaluations soon.

Hi Hilal,

You have to recreate the test environment as shown in this post

![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/carlton/48/56317_2.png)
[Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/316) [Tools in Data Science](/c/courses/tds-kb/34)
> To replicate the test environment:
> Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can run this code using uv.
> # /// script
> # dependencies = [
> # "requests",
> # ]
> # ///
> import requests
> import datetime as dt
> import zoneinfo
> import argparse
> import os
> import zipfile
> parser = argparse.…

That way you will be able to identify why the error was occuring.

The specific error itself means:  
Docker is trying to run the command uv inside your container, but it can’t find the uv executable — it’s not installed or not in the system PATH inside the container.

If you did not run evaluate.py as specified in our live sessions by recreating the test environment and then running evaluate.py then it would not have reflected how your dockerised application would work.

Kind regards

Hi Jayaram,

Unfortunately, we are not able to relax restrictions on changes to your repo, regardless of the reason. We have kept this rule uniform for everyone. If we allow this change, then everyone has a legitimate reason to request changes and would make the rule meaningless because then everyone will be able to make corrections to their submission. We do not even allow spelling changes.

Kind regards

Thanks for the response [@carlton](/u/carlton) .. just a small suggestion, to avoid scenarios like what i faced and also with softwares like docker/podman not being too windows friendly, i think students can find it easier if a dev/mock linux env is provided for course term duration, instead of everyone having to figuring out with AWS/Azure and all providers..

I am writing to you to request you please relook into the evaluation.

The docker image which I share is working at my end. The size of the image is 6 GB which may take more than 5 minutes to load as I wasn’t aware of the infra level restrictions.

I request you to kindly consider my request and please re-evaluate the assignment as I have contributed a lot of effort into it.

Evaluations are done for such cases where Dockerfile(with name of Dockerfile as `Dockerfile`) was present inside other folders than root folder of your github repo.

Hi [@22f3000819](/u/22f3000819)

We had updated datagen.py(try block for task) which affected 30 students, but scores changed only for 4 students, for others it remained the same.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Respected Sir,

I hope you are doing well.  
This is with reference to your confirmation mail that my project 1 will be re-evaluated after end term  
I would like to sincerely apologize for the oversight in my Project 1 submission. Upon reviewing my GitHub repository, I realized that the file was named `dockerfile` (with a lowercase ‘d’) in the Github root repo instead of the required `Dockerfile` (with an uppercase ‘D’).

While the contents of the file were correct and my project passed several evaluation tests, I understand that the evaluation script could not detect the Dockerfile due to this naming issue. I genuinely did not intend to deviate from the standard, and I now fully understand the importance of following naming conventions precisely.

I humbly request you to kindly consider this as an honest mistake and allow a one-time exception, Please sir. This issue has unfortunately resulted in my project score being reduced to 0, which puts my overall course performance at risk. I assure you that I have learned from this experience and such an error will not occur again in the future.  
So, I hope you will look at this and re-evaluate my project as I put lots of efforts to complete it.  
Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,  
S. Sharmile

Hi Everyone,

We have sent the updated marks to Operations. At this time of the term they are very busy with lots of updates, so it will take time for them to push it to the dashboard. As soon as they inform us that the scores have been pushed, we will send out a discrepancy form if you find any issues with your score.

Thanks & Kind regards

Hi Sir,  
I hope you’re doing well. I just wanted to let you know that I put a lot of effort into completing **Project1**, but I accidentally named the **Dockerfile** as `dockerfile` (with a lowercase ‘d’).  
Could you please consider evaluating it with that name? I’d really appreciate it.  
Thank you!

Hello everyone,

I have completed a working project of P2, but I want to test it out with actual questions from the GA’s. Is there anyone that can provide with sample question structure, or 1 or 2 questions as a form of ‘test cases’ so that we can try and fix our project?

Thank you very much in advance

You can do a curl post request or use something like Thunderclient or Postman. If you used fastapi then in the /docs path of your link you will find the open API user interface which you can also use for testing.

I am really facing difficulty completing Project 2 on time as we had our OPPE exam yesterday, and the past week was dedicated to preparing for it. Additionally, due to an unforeseen emergency, I was unable to write the ROE exam, which resulted in lost marks. This makes it even more crucial for me to perform well in this project to make up for it.

I sincerely request if it would be possible to extend the deadline by 2 days. This would allow me to put in my best effort and submit quality work. I truly value this opportunity and would be extremely grateful for your consideration.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

A little more time will help us deploy properly as well. [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) please allow for some more time. Even when working in groups and mixing and matching code… the real messy work is debugging and deployment due to the sheer variety of it. Some are deploying on AWS, some on scalingo, some on Digitalocean, some on Render, some on Azure… even helping amongst ourselves is getting complex because of this.

I have two queries.

1. Could you provide an ETA of GA6 score, GA7 score, final Project 1 score and Project 2 score?
2. I am uncertain about being able to attend the End Semester exam. In case I choose to take the end semester exam next term, will the project scores and ROE score be carried forward to the next term? I don’t know if the marking scheme will change next term or if the old marking scheme is followed for such cases.

Please let me know if possible.

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton),

I’m experiencing the same issue mentioned in this thread regarding Project 1 evaluation emails:

1. The first email I received confirmed all requirements were met (public repo, MIT License, Dockerfile, etc.)
2. The second email incorrectly flagged missing files despite their presence in my repository

Here are screenshots of both emails showing the discrepancy:

My GitHub repo remains publicly accessible with all required components:  
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/23f2000345/TDS_final)

Could you please confirm this was an automated error and that my submission will be evaluated based on the actual repository contents? Your clarification would be greatly appreciated.

Hi,

Prerequisite checks have passed. But your docker image was missing a dependency that you forgot to copy into the image. so it failed to evaluate because it failed to run.

Your Dockerfile was misconfigured. When we try to build the docker image from your github repo, we get this error:

`tried copying parent folder(COPY failed: forbidden path outside the build context: .. ())`

You have to replicate the test environment. If it works when you follow this test setup then you should get in touch with us.

Sir I thought that the ‘LICENSE’ file had to be renamed to ‘MIT LICENSE’.  
Can you please look into it. Thankyou!

Hi [@22f3000585](/u/22f3000585)

Standard MIT License naming criteria is to be named as LICENSE or LICENSE.md(all caps).

I completely appreciate that you feel these are minor issues.

But the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.

Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites.  
Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible.

These things do matter when done at scale. Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter.

Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.

We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.

I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.

Kindest regards

Sir,  
Thankyou for your prompt reply to my query.  
I wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‘LICENSE’ to ‘MIT LICENSE’ on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the 16th of Feb itself).  
I completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th.  
I completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it.  
Thankyou!

One thing we are doing is looking at the latest commit before the 18th of Feb. So if it was correct before the 18th of Feb then we will consider it and evaluate it, but it has to be precisely what is expected. If so, then your submission will be evaluated by building the image from the docker manifest in the github present at the version before the 18th.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir, I want to clarify something about the peer grading process. Some of the files of the student assigned to me are not accessble and others are missing. How am I to grade each thing? From what I understand analysis must be graded based on the shared files but if im not able to access them what should I do? I think requesting view access might violate the spirit of the grading exercise.

Please help me out on what to do. Thanks.

Upon checking further, in the assignment we were asked only to share access with se2002@study.iitm.ac.in . So I think all of us might have this issue. what do we do?

I submitted the form before the deadline with the API endpoint as /api, but I later realized the correct format was /api/ (with a trailing slash). To fix this, I edited the Google Form today.

Will this cause any issues with the submission? Please let me know if any further action is needed.

It is not like that, it can be any endpoint, but whatever you submit should work. Like many frameworks treat /api/ and /api differently.

The project 2 docs assumes that the endpoint is /api/ and provides the code accordingly.

I’m prioritizing PYQs for sure, but between revisiting lectures and attending TA sessions (both quite time-consuming), which one would you recommend focusing on for better returns?

Also, if possible, could you please point out the top 2–3 most important topics—maybe things like LLM, Data Sourcing, etc.—to give more attention to?

I recommend attending the Tues and Thurs session this week or watching the recordings. Its the same every term, those that attend the session score the best marks. I say this because there is no way for me to convey in a discourse post all the important things to focus on. But I can do that in a 2 hour session.

I submitted the project **within the deadline**, and I ensured that **all requirements were fulfilled**, including correctly adding the MIT License file. The license file was named properly and contained the correct content.

However, I received a message stating that the MIT License was not present, and that the prerequisites were not completed — resulting in a failed status. This is surprising and feels unfair, as I’ve double-checked my submission and confirmed that everything, including the license file, is in place and named correctly.

Here is my GitHub repo for your reference: [GitHub - virajpitale/tds-project1](https://github.com/virajpitale/tds-project1)

I kindly request a re-evaluation of my submission, as I believe I’ve met all the required criteria. I would really appreciate your time in looking into this matter again.

Thank you for your understanding.

This is my last term of diploma. So, can I take 1 diploma course and rest degree courses in next term?

TDS is the worst subject to repeat in order to improve CGPA.

Its better to take a high credit, easy course to improve CGPA. **We never recommend taking TDS for grade improvement.** If you have passed it, its better to move on.

Just as matter of interest, even on campus IITM MTech students take foundation Python course from BS Program to artificially improve their on campus CGPA (they take it as an elective).

So if the CGPA is that big a deal, do an easy 4 credit course and get an S. Dont repeat hard subjects, thats just a waste of time.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) Greetings sir!  
Sir, I have a query about the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course. I’ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason?  
As the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation?

Thank you and Regards  
Akshit

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir,  
I hope you are doing well.

As per the grading document, we were informed that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would be considered for grading. However, there was no mention of bonus marks, and before the deadline, we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7. Due to other academic commitments, such as Project 2, some of us were unable to complete GA7.

Now, we have come to know that some of our peers have received an email stating that they have been awarded +5 bonus marks, which directly contribute to the final score. In some cases, this may even impact the final grade. Since this information was not communicated earlier, we kindly request you to consider providing an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn these bonus marks—perhaps through reviewing submissions or another form of assessment.

We sincerely request your understanding on this matter and would be grateful if you could provide an opportunity for us to earn the bonus marks as well.

Looking forward to your kind consideration.

**[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)**  
There seems to be a sudden and unannounced change in the GA marking scheme, which feels quite arbitrary. Initially, we were told that GA would carry 15% weight, calculated as the best 4 out of 7. Based on this, after scoring full marks in four GAs, I didn’t attempt the rest. Even then, I did complete GA5 and GA6, which you can verify.

Now I’m seeing in groups that there’s an “extra benefit” being given for GA7. If any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be communicated clearly via email or discourse. Transparency is important, and as students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance.

I could point out several other issues, but to keep it brief — grading should be fair and consistent. Every student deserves an equal opportunity, and if GA7 is being considered differently, everyone should have the chance to attempt or review it accordingly.

**[@carlton](/u/carlton)**, we request you to kindly consider this matter. We are looking forward to a quick response — hopefully one that ensures fairness for all students.

This would be a deviation from the grading format right sir? As some of us were proactive and closed the 4 GA requirement earlier, if such extra weightage is given to a certain GA unannounced then how is it fair on the other students ?

I have completed 5 GAs, but missed others due to the time commitment required, along with managing three other subjects and one project. I kindly request that 5 bonus marks be awarded to all, as the additional marks for GA were not communicated earlier. This could result in a disadvantage for those of us who were unaware of the extra marks for GA7. Thank you for considering this.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) I genuinely wish I could respond more humbly, but the way this has unfolded makes it hard — and sadly, I’m not MSD to handle it all with silence and a smile.

Good evening [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) Sir,  
I hope you are well

According to the grading document, we were told that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would count towards our final grade. There was no mention of any bonus marks, and we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7 before the deadline. Because of other academic commitments like Project 2, some of us couldn’t complete GA7.

Recently, we found out that some students received an email saying they’ve been given +5 bonus marks for GA7, which directly affects their final score and possibly their overall grade. Since this information wasn’t shared earlier, we kindly request you to consider offering an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn the bonus marks. This could be through a submission review or another form of assessment.

We genuinely hope for your understanding and would be very grateful if you could provide a chance for us to earn the bonus marks too.

Best regards,  
Palaash V. Upadhyay

There seems to be a sudden and unannounced change in the GA marking scheme, which feels quite arbitrary. Initially, we were told that GA would carry 15% weight, calculated as the best 4 out of 7. Based on this, after scoring full marks in four GAs, I didn’t attempt the rest. Even then, I did complete GA5 and GA6, which you can verify.

Now I’m seeing in groups that there’s an “extra benefit” being given for GA7. If any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be communicated clearly via email or discourse. Transparency is important, and as students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance.

I could point out several other issues, but to keep it brief — grading should be fair and consistent. Every student deserves an equal opportunity, and if GA7 is being considered differently, everyone should have the chance to attempt or review it accordingly.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)

The sudden introduction of bonus marks for GA7 in Tools in Data Science has left many students confused, as there was no prior intimation regarding this change. We had all planned our submissions based on the clearly communicated “best 4 out of 7” policy. This unexpected shift has raised concerns about transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic assessment. Fairness is not a privilege to be selectively granted; it is a fundamental right for every student. We respectfully urge the course coordinators to offer clarification and ensure that all students are evaluated on an equal footing. We hope the final grading reflects both justice and academic integrity.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) sir in the grading document it was mentioned best 4 out of 7 assignments but I did 6 GAs but skipped GA7 due to other assignments and projects but now we got to know that 5 bonus marks are given in ga 7 which seems unfair to all of us as mostly people who did GA7 are the one who were not able to complete previous GAs so giving bonus for the last day give them a edge

If it was announced before deadline of GA 7 it was okay and good for us to improve our grade but now it seems quite unfair so, please come with the best possible solution for this

Thanking you

To all the people who are posting in this thread, I kindly request you to get the correct facts and data before starting a new thread.

So here are the first steps towards making this thread a more informed one:

1. What is the policy related to bonus for Diploma level courses as per grading policy document?
2. What is the policy adopted in previous instances of TDS?
3. Did anyone read the text related to bonus marks associated with GA7?
4. Does anyone know what should be done to get the bonus?
5. Has anyone inquired about effort involved in getting the bonus?
6. After answering all the above, has someone actually tried to follow instructions in the “mail” to get the bonus?

Patiently waiting for all your responses.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) this is really unfair, on one hand you all are giving 0 to project 1 submission even because of slighest mistake and on the other giving free marks to students who attempted the GA7. Most of us were not able to attend the GA7 and it was not mentioned beforehand that we have 5 marks bonus for GA7. Please give the peer review bonus to those who did not attempt the GA7 or else it is really unfair for other students.

Greetings!

I came across your response in the Discourse thread regarding the bonus marks and GA7, and I wanted to reach out respectfully to seek some clarification.

I did go through the grading policy and the bonus marks section, but I’m still a bit confused about your message in the thread — especially regarding the specific steps we should take or refer to in order to understand the bonus marks related to GA7 and peer reviews. For ROE and the Week 4 GA, bonus marks were mentioned here on Discourse

Could you kindly guide me on what exactly we should refer to (such as any email, document, or past policy) and what steps are expected from us to be eligible for the bonus?  
Also, would students who completed all 5 assignments (but missed GA7) have any alternative way to earn bonus marks through peer reviews or other contributions?

Apologies if I’ve missed something already mentioned. Your clarification would be really helpful for me and others who are in a similar situation.

[@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil) Thank you so much for your time and guidance.

Warm regards,

I hope this message finds you well [@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil) sir.

Firstly, I would like to sincerely apologize for any misunderstandings that may have arisen. I have the utmost respect for the grading system and for the esteemed professors at IITM, and I deeply value the effort put into the course.

However, as a student, I am hoping to clarify the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course.

Addressing the queries you raised in your post:

> 1. What is the policy related to bonus for Diploma level courses as per grading policy document?

In previous modules, such as Project 1, bonus marks were awarded for completing additional tasks (1 bonus mark per task if the code handled them correctly). Similarly, in GA4, bonus marks were given for replying in Discourse. These bonus marks, however, were specific to the respective modules and did not affect the final grading.

> 2. What is the policy adopted in previous instances of TDS?

I am not fully aware of the policies adopted in previous terms for the TDS course.

> 3. Did anyone read the text related to bonus marks associated with GA7?

I have read the email regarding GA7 and the associated bonus marks. The email states that:

> Dear Learner,  
> DEADLINE: 10th April, 2025 23:59:59pm  
> GA7 requires you to submit 3 peer evaluations, so that you may be graded for your submission.  
> Please find the form link below to submit your evaluations.  
> <https://forms.gle/DhBW4xdKyv7hXhXD9>  
> AFTER completing your initial 3 peer reviews which were sent in the previous email,  
> if you submit 5 additional reviews, you will be awarded upto 5 BONUS MARKS to your final T score. For example if your final TDS score is 75, doing all 5 extra peer reviews can boost your final score in TDS to 80.  
> You will have to submit the form 5 times (1 for each peer). Use the same form link to submit 5 different reviews. Your Bonus score will still be based on the metrics derived for the initial 3 peer reviews, but scaled for 5 peer reviews.  
> You have been given the peer submissions as links to HTML files which you have to download and view in a browser.

> 4. Does anyone know what should be done to get the bonus?

From the information in the email, I infer that students who complete the additional reviews are eligible for bonus marks, which will be added to their overall total marks.

> 5. Has anyone inquired about effort involved in getting the bonus?

My peers and I have worked diligently to complete all required tasks, including the ROE and projects. Earning additional bonus marks is certainly a challenging milestone, and we understand that it requires considerable effort.

> 6. After answering all the above, has someone actually tried to follow instructions in the “mail” to get the bonus?

Unfortunately, I can’t follow the instructions because I did not receive the email about submitting extra peer reviews, as it appears to have been sent to those who participated in GA7.  
…

Given this context, I would appreciate it if you could kindly clarify the situation for students who completed all GAs from 1 to 6 (or did their best 4 GAs) but did not participate in GA7. Specifically, I would like to understand why only those who completed GA7 are receiving the bonus marks email regarding peer reviews.

Please note that I ask this purely for clarification and with the utmost respect for the professors and the grading system, as I have no intention of creating controversy. I simply wish to understand the criteria.  
Thank you for your time and consideration [@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil) sir.

Best regards,  
Akshit Mittal

The mail you have pasted has definitely come from one of your peer in the course. You can try clicking the form, evaluation criteria for reviews have been provided in the form itself. If in further doubt, try doing one review with the peer who shared the email. Now try answering Q5.

And in case you have more doubts, you can refer to the live session that happened today. I believe most of it was spent on clarifying what the bonus is for.

Completely understand. And we too are trying to help you understand the criteria through these discussions. And believe me, we are also learning in the process.

Yes [@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil) sir, I did receive this email from one of my peers, although we are not closely acquainted, making it difficult to complete a review with the peer who shared the email.

Since the beginning of the course, it has been emphasized that the **TDS course focuses more on teamwork** and collaborative learning than individual study. I fully believe this concept and worked together with my group. I created Colab files for 4 GAs for my peers(more than 250 peers must have benefited from it), and **my peers supported me with Project 1 and 2.** **They were mainly responsible for helping me score the full marks in the first two minutes of the ROE** release and we had a meeting after ROE, which was scheduled with you.

I understand that earning bonus marks for GA7 will be difficult. However, I had no opportunity to participate in this process even after submitting six GAs, while attempting only GA7 (which I understand presents a slim chance) may grant me 5 bonus marks. I acknowledge that the chances are difficult, but many of my peers who didn’t submit GA7, including myself, feel we deserve an opportunity.

Sir, I am not questioning the grading system but I think it would have been helpful if we had known earlier that peer reviews in GA7 would be part of earning bonus marks. In GA4, Anand Sir made it clear that anyone who asked or answered a question in the GA4 discussion would receive bonus marks but these were specific to GA4 (e.g., a score of 110 out of 100), not the overall grading.

To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. I am not pointing out mistakes, but I just feel the information about the bonus could have been shared more clearly.

Finally, I want to thank everyone with whom I have connected during this course. I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible, especially after submitting six GAs, the ROE, and two projects. I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation.

I’d also like to mention that with the end-term exams just three days away, most of us will be focusing on preparing for them. However, I trust you’ll definitely take our concerns into consideration, and we remain hopeful for clarity regarding the bonus marks.  
Thank you once again for your understanding.

It is good to see that you have been actively collaborating with your peers and both have benefitted from this. Here is the main query that most people are having:

![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2004636/48/86136_2.png) 23f2004636:
> To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system.

Here is my response, and I have consulted with the course instructors before sharing this:

Every term in TDS, both instructors and students are not aware of what bonuses are going to be given out at the start of term. Bonus activities are created at any point, at the discretion of the course team, and the information is not disseminated in a wide fashion. It’s primarily a reward mechanic for those that really are interested in engaging in the whole breadth of the course. For instance, in the last two terms the bonus activities required them to post their solutions in Discourse where the problem statement.

The course team do not invent GAs for the sake of giving opportunities for scoring marks. They are opportunities to learn and put that learning to use. Another goal is for the GAs to be opportunities to learn by collaborating with each other.

192 students took that opportunity to engage with GA7. If no one is interested in doing the GA, then why should the team take the effort to create it? Would you rather prefer that we make it mandatory for all students to do all GAs (by making GAA = average of all GA Scores)? Some courses do that. We were very lenient in our GA scoring because the course is tough. Students benefitted from that leniency. Should we reverse our leniency so that everyone “gets the opportunity to get bonus marks?” Think about this

As a course team, they did not know beforehand that they were going to give opportunities for any bonuses when GA 7 was created. So there was no information to give. Please do understand that the course team do not knowingly hide things from students (that’s a viewpoint that some students seem to suggest with their posts or at least).

When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence?

It is extraordinary that it appears you would prefer if those students, who actually put in the effort, would not be given the opportunity! You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. They thought it was worth the effort **before** there was any chance of a bonus. And now you begrudge them that reward for their own diligence.

Once again reiterating this point - Bonus marks are given for activities to students at the discretion of the course team. It always has been. And it has never been widely available to all students in past terms of TDS either. This term is no exception. They are never decided beforehand. They are created as and when there seems to be an appropriate opportunity to reward students for their effort.

The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. But it’s not guaranteed for them either. They have to put in a significant coordinated effort with their peers to actually achieve that. In other words, it’s not a freebie.

I had promised to provide the distribution of people who did GA7 both in terms of number of assignments done and average score in GAA. Here is the data below:

| # Assignments Done | # students |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 42 |
| 1 | 33 |
| 2 | 22 |
| 3 | 19 |
| 4 | 23 |
| 5 | 28 |

| Assignment\_Score | # students |
| --- | --- |
| 0-10 | 75 |
| 11-20 | 19 |
| 21-30 | 15 |
| 31-40 | 9 |
| 41-50 | 13 |
| 51-60 | 7 |
| 61-70 | 11 |
| 71-80 | 12 |
| 81-90 | 10 |
| 91-100 | 17 |

Thank you for sharing the data [@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil) Sir

The data clearly supports my assumption that the majority of students attempted GA7 primarily to secure 100% in GAA, or to boost their GAA scores, with learning being a secondary priority.  
Anyway, it is what it is.

**[@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil) Sir**,  
Thank you for the detailed explanation. I just have one sincere doubt:

As you mentioned, the intention behind the GA7 bonus is to reward extra effort in GAs—but why are 5 bonus marks being added to the **total course marks**, instead of awarding **15/100 of the total** to those who did GA7 exceptionally well?

Students like me, who have consistently scored 100% in all GAs (excluding GA7) and have been actively participating in the Discourse forum from the beginning, seem to be left out. Don’t we deserve some recognition for our consistent efforts too?

It’s not about jealousy—it’s about acknowledging those who have put in their day and night from the start, completing every GA diligently and earning bonus marks as per the criteria already defined for earlier GAs.

I’m only concerned about **my own marks**, and I just wish for a fair system that values consistent effort across the term.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

However, I just want to point out a potential nuance: Many of the 192 students who did GA7 may have done so *not* for extra learning but simply to ensure their top 4 GAs included 4 full scores (e.g., to replace a lower-scoring GA). So the distinction between diligence-for-learning and diligence-for-grade-maximizing becomes blurred.

Now that bonus marks are announced *after* the deadline, those who already had 4 perfect scores and skipped GA7 based on the stated structure (top 4 out of 7) are essentially penalized for playing the game by the original rules — not for a lack of diligence or engagement.

I’m not questioning the bonus system itself, just pointing out that such surprises can unintentionally favor certain strategies over others — and more transparency around this in future terms might help students make better-informed decisions without second-guessing themselves later.

Sir, why is GA7 given the atmost priority and the bonus of GA7 is not awarded to GA7 alone but is awarded as bonus to the entire total score of the course.

If the team wants to award the bonus marks for the consistent performance then they should consider the best 5 or 6 GAs and award bonus accordingly. It is unfair that those who just attempted GA7 are been given bonus marks to the entire course. If you wish to provide bonus marks then provide the bonus marks for GA7 alone, the same way as it was done for GA4.

The main issue is that the bonus marks concept was never informed prior. The team should not take actions at random as it would affect many students. As per grading document, only best 4 out of 7 GAs were supposed to be considered. Even if the team wishes to give the bonus mark then it should be given to the GA7 alone and not entire total score.

Sir as per the current logic, say a person just attends GA7 alone and doesnt attend any another thing then he would also be awarded bonus 5 marks to his total score just because of the fact that they **attended** GA7. Whereas students who have been submitting Ga1 to 6 and werent able to submit GA7 alone as per current logic are not being considered for the bonus mark. This is unfair.

Please think from our side.

Regards  
Karthik

Sir, this sounds reasonably fair. But, what about the students who were lethargic in probably week 1 or week 2, thinking that they can solve the GAs of later weeks? They also get benefitted from this.

I think the attitude of these students is the same as those who skipped GA& as they got 100% GAA within the first five or six weeks

I wanted to follow up on my previous message regarding the 5 bonus marks for GA7 and further elaborate on the impact this may have on overall grades.

As outlined in the grading document, the best 4 out of 7 GA assignments carry a total of 15 marks. Since many students, including myself, scored well in our best 4 assignments, which were prioritized as we aimed to maximize our grades, we did not attempt GA7. The bonus marks for GA7 were announced after the deadline, which has led to a concern that this may create an imbalance in the overall grading.

For students who excelled in their top 4 assignments, the additional 5 marks from GA7 may not significantly alter their overall grade, as they have already demonstrated strong performance. Conversely, those who struggled initially and attempted GA7 in hopes of improving their grade may benefit more from this bonus. This could inadvertently disadvantage those of us who strategically focused on the highest scoring opportunities available to us.

Given that the bonus marks were introduced after grades were finalized, I respectfully ask if there’s a possibility to consider an adjustment in these

Thank you for taking the time to respond in detail. I’d like to respectfully share a few clarifications in response to some of the points raised.

![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/jkmadathil/48/100121_2.png) jkmadathil:
> When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence?

With due respect sir, I want to clarify that in my original message, I stated:

*“I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible…I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation.”*

As mentioned above, my intention was never to express **jealousy**. It was simply an enquiry for clarity, especially around the communication and criteria related to the bonus system. The assumption that those who did not attempt GA7 chose not to put in effort is not accurate, respectfully.

![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/jkmadathil/48/100121_2.png) jkmadathil:
> You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all.

I would like to point out that many of us, myself included, showed consistent diligence by completing and submitting GA1 through GA6. **Personally, I solved GA5 and GA6 even after solving my Best 4 GAs purely for the learning experience**, knowing they wouldn’t necessarily impact my grade directly. I never avoided GA7 out of carelessness—I simply prioritized the fact that only the best 4 GA scores would count. This is not a lack of effort or interest in the subject matter.

Further, you mentioned:

![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/jkmadathil/48/100121_2.png) jkmadathil:
> The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity.

I completely respect the effort put in by those students.  
However, I would like to offer another perspective: what if some among those 192 had not completed their best 4 GAs prior to GA7? Meanwhile, those of us who consistently completed all previous GAs(excluding GA7) from the start are now excluded from this opportunity—not due to lack of interest, but due to lack of communication.

If the bonus is truly a recognition of effort *specific to GA7*, then it might be more fair to reflect that in the **GA7 score** only, not in the **overall course total**, which affects students who were consistently involved across the term.

I know I’m still learning and have a long way to go—there’s so much about the world, professionalism, and fairness that I hope to understand better through experiences and guidance of professors and through the exposure from the college. But I also believe that seeking clarity is part of that learning.

Thank you once again for reading my message and considering my point of view.

Thank you for the response sir, however my doubt was regarding a different issue.

It is not that I am jealous of their diligence or anything, its simply that even from the data you provided above, it seems that a majority of students, 141 out of the 192 students have not actually even done 4 assignments. So they might have done GA7 for the 4 GAA criteria, not just due to diligence. Once again I am not stating that they were all like that, but rather it is a possibility.

Another issue is that a lot of students might have originally worked hard on earlier assignments to score well but may not have had the time for later assignments such as college students like myself who have end term examinations ongoing currently. Since I saw that I had already put in the effort to do all 6 assignments prior, I only did not do the GA7 since it clashed with my examinations.

Once again I am not blaming the instructors for this situation sir but the bonus 5 marks can very well change which grade we get in the end, which is the reason why I have created this message. The students who have attempted GA7 do deserve extra marks for their work but if others were informed of the extra 5 marks then we may have also taken part in it, even if we had other prior commitments.

Thank you once again for reading this message sir and kindly consider our point of view.

[@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)

Sir, as said in this another students’ post, i would also like to bring your notice to the fact that most of those 192 students who attempted the GA7 have not done 4 assignments. This shows their “diligence” which you are awarding them for. Whereas the students like us who have been submitting all the projects and the assignments GA1 to 6, how can the team conclude that just because we didnt submit GA7 we are not diligent enough to be awarded the bonus marks.

Shouldnt the bonus marks be awarded to those students who have been submitting literally all 2 projects and 6 assignments(6/7 i.e 85% of the assignments)? How could the team decide to award bonus 5 marks to the overall score just to those students based on a single assignment( namely GA7). We are genuinely struggling, and we are requesting bonus marks based on that. Please don’t misunderstand our request as jealousy — it comes from a place of hardship.

How can a student who submitted 1 assignment make him more diligent than those who have been submitting 2 projects and 6 assignments. I think if you plan to award bonus marks you should consider best 5 or 6 assignments and not just based on a single assignment.

Just because we didnt submit a assignment(GA7) why are we being deprived of the bonus marks which was not even informed of. If you want to provide the bonus marks then you can also consider the best 4 assignments as well as it would also show the students’ interest and diligence as you said. If you want to consider for the bonus marks you can consider any assignment right, why just GA7 is the question. You can also award the bonus marks based of GA-1 or GA-2 or so. I think the diligence which are talking of, should be measured based on consistent performance and not just based on a single assignment.

Karthik

Hi everyone,

A bit of data might be useful. Its been interesting reading all your posts, I thought I might share some brief insights.

Firstly students *vastly* overestimate the ease of getting bonus marks in TDS.

So of the approx 200 students that did GA7: The top bonus mark was 3.  
Only 2 students managed it.

Going by that statistic, of the 600 students who are active in TDS, possibly 6 *might* have even managed to get 3 or more marks.

*So lets not pretend that this was easy by any stretch of the imagination.* The mean bonus score was 1.27.

So, on average, you would get less than a 1/3rd GAs worth of marks for the extra effort of an entire GA+extra work. The psychology study it revealed however is interesting on this thread to see. The difference between perception and reality. My advice is stop reacting emotionally and evaluate rationally.

That is the data for you.

[![Student Bonus](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/0/1/017f0ec92b42bfae7104a70faba6d9d7ebb64ed4.png)Student Bonus600×371 7.62 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/0/1/017f0ec92b42bfae7104a70faba6d9d7ebb64ed4.png "Student Bonus")

### Also noteworthy

Bonus marks in TDS are never made known ahead of time for any term in the past and neither will it be in the future.

None of us knew that there were going to be bonuses after the submission of GA7. Please stop requesting, “at least you should let us know before GA7”. How can we let you know, if we ourselves were not aware there were going to be bonus marks?

Bonuses are always surprise opportunities that are *not* widely available to everyone. For example we never release them on the seek portal. In the past Anand has released them on discourse, where typically, in previous terms, less than a fraction of a third of the students are even engaged, let alone active. Of course students in the past complained saying, they did not know and were not informed. To which the response was, maybe you should be more actively engaged on discourse. How many people typically tried TDS bonus in the past? Probably around 50. So compared to previous terms, this term is a huge improvement!

**Bonuses are not a right.** They are opportunities that become available for those that are engaged with the course. Where and when that opportunity becomes available varies. A bit like real life.

However we have read all your concerns and we have decided to put a disclaimer in the grading document for future terms:

> Opportunities for bonus marks might become available for activities linked to any of the GAs, Projects or Course Modules. The may be revealed at anytime, on any platform (seek, discourse, course site) and through any medium (official email, discourse) at the discretion of the course team. Bonus marks are not guaranteed and are awarded at the discretion of the course team.

The rubric is challenging and requires some level of collaboration with others. Thats why the bonus marks are low. Also the there is minimum requirement for even being eligible for it, i.e. you must complete GA7 and give 3 peer reviews before you can even be considered for bonus eligibility.

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir and [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir,

Sir, As per your instructions, I had reached out to my peers well in advance; however, only 3 out of 8 responded. While 2–3 of the worksheets were publicly accessible, many remained private despite the ample time provided. This raises the possibility that the individual assigned to grade those particular sheets—aside from myself—may also not have had access, potentially affecting the overall grading accuracy.

Additionally, I noticed that some worksheets were largely incomplete or just a single sheet was provided, and there is a chance that a few participants may have copy-pasted their own values because the if the sheet were provide and access wasn’t given, the probability of the correct values being there was really high, which could further influence the evaluations. Admittedly there were quite a lot of empty sheets too which I gave zero as deserved but this might not have been the case with other evaluators.

Given these factors, I wanted to kindly request clarification on how these were handled. Was there a specific threshold required to qualify for the bonus, and how are such inconsistencies accounted  
Sir, some of us(including me) have submitted all 7 GAs and despite the end term we approached peers and completed all 8 reviews even when we had already got 90-110 in first four with average being 100 so I hope we could be graded fairly and appropriately for our efforts.

I am frankly surprised by this outcome. I don’t see how there could have been large variances in scores different evaluators would have given to a student.

I hope the data is not being skewed because of the total number of evaluations being low, or because of differing perceptions about how a student needs to be scored, or any other reason.

Thank you for raising a proper point about the fairness of the issue. The course’s rules seems to be changed on a whim, which is pretty unfair to those of us who completed the first 6 assignments properly. If anything, why not inform the +5 bonus before declaring the GA-7. “Rewarding diligence” is a vague point as completing 6 out of 7 assignments requires a decent commitment to the course. Getting rewarded for completing all 7 assignments is something absolutely commendable, without a doubt but getting a +5 on the basis of simply GA-7 is vague because it doesn’t guarantee the commitment towards the other 6 assignments. A person who has completed 6 assignments, skipping GA 7 is less diligent than someone who completed 4 assignments including GA7 is the summary I am gathering : )  
Please correct me if I am wrong

I appeared for the end term examination held on 13th April 2025 during the FN shift. I would like to bring to your attention that the exam interface did not provide an option for multiple selections. However, a few questions appeared to have multiple correct answers.

I have noted down the specific questions and the corresponding options I believe to be correct.So, kindly review them and let me know if there were any errors in my understanding of the questions. The questions are as follows:

[![1000042547](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/f/d/fd08e14665989ccea8f5a547b569521575208ae8_2_690x369.jpeg)10000425471080×578 187 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/d/fd08e14665989ccea8f5a547b569521575208ae8.jpeg "1000042547")

Question 2: Fields needed to filter “POST requests under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays”

To filter such logs, we need:

Time → for the hour and the day (Monday)  
Method → to filter POST  
URL → to filter /images/

So, the correct minimal set is:

> ![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") Time, Method, URL

Time → needed ![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:")  
Method → needed ![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:")  
URL → needed ![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:")  
Referer → not needed, but not harmful

So this option includes all the necessary fields, just with one extra — which doesn’t invalidate it.

[![1000042548](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/9/0/9062a032d89a4b2b049ca34b23905d501cba7913_2_690x192.jpeg)10000425481080×301 71.5 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/9/0/9062a032d89a4b2b049ca34b23905d501cba7913.jpeg "1000042548")

Acc to solutions only option 6406534159827 is valid:

Status is numeric (200)  
Method (GET), Protocol (HTTP/1.1), and URL (/index.html) are correct

All required fields are present and properly formatted

The other options were as follows:

9825 uses invalid protocol (INVALID)

9826 uses invalid status code (OK instead of numeric)

9824 has no critical issue — it is technically also valid (only uses a private IP 192.168.1.1, which is unusual but not invalid). So both 9824 and 9827 are valid, but the answer marked only 9827

[![1000042545](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/0/3/03aec49b7ba39078f204ef24fefa80dae8e9b373_2_690x299.jpeg)10000425451079×468 35.7 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/0/3/03aec49b7ba39078f204ef24fefa80dae8e9b373.jpeg "1000042545")  
Correct Answer(s):

![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") PUT – Correct: It replaces the resource entirely. Multiple identical PUTs = same result.

![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") GET – Also correct: It only fetches data, no side-effects. Multiple GETs = same result.

![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14 ":white_check_mark:") DELETE – Technically correct: Deleting the same resource multiple times has the same result as deleting once (resource stays deleted).

---

Incorrect Answer:

![:cross_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/cross_mark.png?v=14 ":cross_mark:") POST – Not idempotent. Each POST usually creates a new resource or changes server state.

(This is the mistake on my part that I put the ans as POST as I thought since 3/4 are idempotent and one is not I should select the odd one out but I hope this could be resolved)

Thank you

Agree & second all thoughts shared by [@24f2003130](/u/24f2003130) above.

* I also wanted to clarify on this question on filtered entries. The question mentions that a list filtered\_entries is being created , and with the way the question is structured it seems like the filtering conditions mentioned in the question have already been applied. In that case `len(filtered entries)` seems to be correct. However the right answer is marked ‘None of these’ .  
  [![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/f/5/f5f549e906df1006709b3257742fff4b52f416d0_2_690x245.png)image1108×394 81.9 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/5/f5f549e906df1006709b3257742fff4b52f416d0.png "image")
* The valid log entry had me stumped too, option 1 and 4 both look absolutely fine yet only option 4 is marked correct.
* Also, only POST request is not idempotent, all other requests are idempotent yet only PUT is marked correct.

Request you to please clarify and consider these points.

Yes [@carlton](/u/carlton) the wording of the question made it seem like the filters were already applied on the list `filtered_entries`.

# Clarifications on Queries

1. **Which of the following is a valid log entry based on the provided format?**  
   Due to a technical issue in the portal, both options 1 and 4 are correct answers. The final scoring has been adjusted accordingly, and full marks will be awarded for either response.
2. **HTTP method is idempotent**  
   This question has been excluded from scoring as three methods (GET, PUT, and DELETE) are idempotent, with only POST being non-idempotent.
3. **Entries with 404 status code**  
   Although the instructions did not explicitly state that filters applied for status code 404, we acknowledge this ambiguity. Full credit will be awarded for both option 1 and option 4.
4. **Which of the following fields are necessary to filter “POST requests made for pages under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays”?**  
   Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL) is correct because:

* Option B includes Size and Status, which aren’t needed for filtering by time, method, and URL
* Option C includes Referer, which is unnecessary unless filtering by source page
* Option D includes Status and Server, which aren’t relevant for this specific filtering requirement

Thank you for the clarification provided regarding Question 4 and resolution of errors in other questions. I understand the reasoning behind choosing Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL). However, I respectfully believe Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) is more accurate for the following reasons:

1. Redundancy in Option A:  
   The Request field already contains the HTTP method, URL, and protocol (e.g., “POST /images/logo.png HTTP/1.1”). Including both Request and separate Method and URL fields introduces redundancy. If we already extract Method and URL separately for filtering, the full Request field becomes unnecessary.
2. Simplicity in Filtering:  
   Filtering for “POST requests under /images/” from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays can be done using:

Time → for checking the hour and weekday.

Method → to filter only POST.

URL → to ensure the request is under /images/.

Thus, Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) already includes all needed fields. While Referer is not essential, it doesn’t interfere with the filtering and might be useful in future extended filtering cases (e.g., source tracking). Therefore, Option C is complete and accurate without being redundant.

3. Consistency with Log Parsing Practices:  
   In most log analysis scripts or systems (e.g., Python’s re or pandas parsing of logs), Method and URL are parsed from Request for separate use. This further supports the idea that including Request alongside Method and URL is not best practice.

Sir, regarding point 3, score-checker tells a different story. While all the other changes have been made with the same reflecting in the score, that question still says “The question and answer remain the same . No changes required”, which is different from your post.

![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/4/0/404e7b25f4155d41d4939b07fd45fa3c120beadd_2_690x31.png)

Can you please look into it?

It seems that the option to download the answer key has been removed. However, you could consider reaching out to someone in the group or checking the dashboard for solution pdf of question paper. You can then match the questions in order, even if the IDs don’t align exactly—it should still give you a general idea. From there, you can proceed accordingly.

[@iamprasna](/u/iamprasna) [@carlton](/u/carlton) Please look into it once. According to point 3 of [@iamprasna](/u/iamprasna)’s post, I should get full credit for that question and it will take me to a perfect 100 score in ET from the current 97. I brought this into attention before the scores were pushed to the dashboard.

The correction has been done to the following question for both the FN and AN sessions. You must be able to see the change in scores shortly

1. **Entries with 404 status code**  
   Although the instructions did not explicitly state that filters applied for status code 404, we acknowledge this ambiguity. Full credit will be awarded for both option 1 and option 4.
