    We have removed that button, cause it was causing confusion among the students. 
If you have saved your answers on the TDS portal then you need not worry, you will be marked. The button was just there to ensure you saw the assignment on the TDS portal.

TDS TA

Your scores are evaluated on a site that is external to the seek portal and is not integrated with the seek portal. Therefore seek does not know if you have submitted or not and by default says that it has not been submitted because it cannot see your external evaluation. There will not be a fix for this for some time.
Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal.
<strong>The scores will only be visible in the dashboard.</strong> Just ignore anything inside seek portal. The dashboard is where all your subject score cards exists.
As stated in multiple places on discourse as well as in live sessions, The final score is always your last submission. If your dashboard score does not match your final submission score on the assignment page, only then contact us regarding your marks.
Kind regards

Dear Bhavanagv,
The scores have not been pushed to the dashboard yet. Ignore seek portal. Seek portal will not have your submission or your scores because it is evaluated externally from the seek portal.
Kind regards

There are some errors in grading for GA2 and  GA3 for TDS, even after submitting the assignments score 0 was given and the seek portal displayed assignment was not submitted given that the login was from my own account and was submitted before the time and still got a score of 0.<br>

Only 1st Graded assignment scores are visible on dashboard.  I have submitted 2nd and 3rd GA before the deadline but still it showing “not submitted” on the seek portal…

I recently got mail and checked my marks for GA2 and noticed that the final score is showing as <strong>4.25</strong>, but while attempting the assignment earlier, I had scored <strong>7.25</strong> shown after submission.
Could you please help me understand how the marks were reduced? I want to ensure there was no error or misunderstanding in the evaluation.

Hi Satish,
Your last submitted score is the only valid score. You have to check before submitting that the score is correct. There is a reload button to load previous answers. But some answers require a live service. If the live service is not running at the time of the check (when you hit the submit button), you will not be scored for those questions. Please make sure that you have any live services running when the submit button is used and check that the last saved score is correct.
Kind regards
