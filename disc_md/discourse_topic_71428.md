# Request for Extension on TDS Project 2 Deadline

I am really facing difficulty completing Project 2 on time as we had our OPPE exam yesterday, and the past week was dedicated to preparing for it. Additionally, due to an unforeseen emergency, I was unable to write the ROE exam, which resulted in lost marks. This makes it even more crucial for me to perform well in this project to make up for it.
I sincerely request if it would be possible to extend the deadline by 2 days. This would allow me to put in my best effort and submit quality work. I truly value this opportunity and would be extremely grateful for your consideration.
Thank you for your time and understanding.

A little more time will help us deploy properly as well. <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> please allow for some more time. Even when working in groups and mixing and matching code… the real messy work is debugging and deployment due to the sheer variety of it. Some are deploying on AWS, some on scalingo, some on Digitalocean, some on Render, some on Azure… even helping amongst ourselves is getting complex because of this.
