Hello Sir,
I understand from the email we received that there are three mock ROEs scheduled. I wanted to check if it is mandatory to attempt the mock at 7 PM or if there is flexibility in the timing. As a working professional, I may not be able to attempt the mock at 7 PM.
Could you please confirm if there is any flexibility in the timings? Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide details on when and how the mock links will be shared.
Thanks and Regards<br>
Shalini

Tag the TAs and instructor. Otherwise, you may not get the answer in time…

It is not mandatory to attempt mocks at 7pm. But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later.
ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma.
Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities.<br>
The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time.<br>
<em>The problem is the lack of time.</em>
So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand.
Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next.
Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE.
The real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before.<br>
But we will help you be as ready as possible for it.
Kind regards

You will get an email at 7pm with the ROE dataset and the question form.<br>
I will also add the same in the student seek portal.<br>
Mock ROEs are not proctored (its a mock!) and the actual ROE is not proctored either!<br>
The gmeet is after the mock ROE where it will be solved live by the TDS team.
Kind regards

Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> , I will not be able to solve the mock in the given time due to other commitments. The grading document says 2 marks bonus for mocks. Will this be a part of that? If yes, is there any other way? As you have mentioned, I will keep a timer and try to solve it in 45 minutes.

No, we do not provide solutions as a notebook. The ROE will be solved during the live session.

yes in live session ROE was solved but while taking reference for Q1 from live session from TAs to see how this question might be solved as i was getting wrong answer, but TA also didnt solved that question in correct manner he got wrong, I think we should have at least 1 standard ref for all the questions of this mock roe to understand our mistakes in solving this questions pls understand thanks,<br>
also when i went throught live session recording i can see only 1 screen of 1 ta

For Today’s ROE you will be able to check answers immediately
For Thrusday’s ROE as well there will be some mechanism for checking answers.
Kind regards.
