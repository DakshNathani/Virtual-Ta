Hi Carlton,<br>
I am writing to confirm the basic requirements for successfully completing the course.
As I understand, the criteria for passing are:
<ol>
<li>Achieving a score greater than 40 marks in the graded assignments.</li>
<li>Securing more than 40 marks in the end-term examination.</li>
</ol>
Could you kindly confirm if this understanding is accurate? Additionally, please let me know if there are any other prerequisites to be met.

Final course score T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2P2 + 0.25F<br>
Final T &gt;= 40 (or less depending on any certificates for disabilities/SCST/OB etc.)
