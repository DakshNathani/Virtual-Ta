Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> &amp; <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a>
I was wondering if we can have access to the companion notebook for the application for order built on 31st Jan 2025. Where can we access this ?

Hi Vikram,
Those notebooks are for internal purpose only, we donâ€™t use to share them.
Kind regards
