Dear all,
I’m thrilled to share a project inspired by my experience in the *Tools in Data Science * course: <a href="https://github.com/AvinashShrivastav/LLM_Assignment_Evaluator_GoogleClassroom" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><strong>LLM Classroom Assignment Evaluator</strong></a>.  This is the basic prototype.
This tool leverages Google APIs and LLMs to automate grading and feedback for Google Classroom assignments, making evaluation faster and more insightful for educators.
A heartfelt thanks to <strong><a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a></strong>, our course instructor, and TAs <strong><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@Carlton</a></strong> and <strong><a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a></strong>, whose guidance on LLM function calling and real-world applications made this project possible.
I’d love to invite contributions from this amazing community to:
<ul>
<li>Expand functionality and evaluation models.</li>
<li>Fix bugs and optimize workflows.</li>
<li>Improve documentation for broader accessibility.</li>
</ul>
The <a href="https://github.com/AvinashShrivastav/LLM_Assignment_Evaluator_GoogleClassroom" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitHub repository</a> is open for forks, pull requests, and ideas. I look forward to collaborating with you all!
Update: here is a video explaining the process - <a href="https://youtu.be/xa4zhP-S3NE?feature=shared" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://youtu.be/xa4zhP-S3NE?feature=shared</a><br>

Hi Avinash,
Thats great work! I am glad you were able to use what you learnt from the course for something so practical. I hope you continue to develop and refine it, take feedback from the stakeholders who would be interested in this approach. I see a lot of potential in this project.
Kind regards
