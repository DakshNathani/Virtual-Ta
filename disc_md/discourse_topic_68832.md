<a class="mention" href="/u/bhashwar_sengupta">@bhashwar_sengupta</a> No that will not be possible. It will go live only at 1 pm.

[Link to Post](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/remote-online-exam-tds-jan-2025/601568)

Got it. Thank you. Also, are there any standard set of instructions that we need to follow during the ROE, like in OPPEs?

[Link to Post](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/remote-online-exam-tds-jan-2025/601588)

Is it 45 minutes long?

[Link to Post](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/remote-online-exam-tds-jan-2025/601648)

No, it is 45 minutes ‘short’

<a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> will exam take place on the IITM Exam Portal (like other JAVA, Python OPPE) or will it take place on the TDS course portal like we had for Weekly GA?

Hello <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> sir, I could only find one live session of ROE in youtube. Can you please point out where are the other recordings?

[Link to Post](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/remote-online-exam-tds-jan-2025/601837)

All week 7 sessions are ROE mock solving questions. Only the 4th session was a special session and was labelled as such, but it also has a mock solving component. These are all available on the Youtube channel

Sir we have to join the google meet for ROE or it’s an open book exam?

[Link to Post](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/remote-online-exam-tds-jan-2025/602053)

Is there a google meet that we have to join for proctoring?

<a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a>
I hope the Remote Online Exam (ROE) is ready to be uploaded to the portal. Is there any update regarding the additional time request? Can we expect any consideration on this?

Yup! Based on previous GAs, 45 minutes seems pretty short.

[Link to Post](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/remote-online-exam-tds-jan-2025/602146)

HOW WILL WE BE ABLE TO ACCESS ANSWERS, WHETHER THEY ARE CORRECT OR INCORRECT. JUST LIKE IN GAs?? will we have a “check” button??

[Link to Post](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/remote-online-exam-tds-jan-2025/602147)

Its fine the link is correct. Just that the exam is not available at the moment, we have changed the error message. Exam will start at 1pm. Its also hackable to start before.

You will have a check button

thanks a ton <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> and to all the TAs. Performed much better in ROE than I expected!!

[Link to Post](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/remote-online-exam-tds-jan-2025/602214)

ROE was challenging, but definitely Mocks helped a lot. I think mocks were the best preparation for ROE. Did good because of it.

Your answer is absolutely correct <a class="mention" href="/u/23f2000573">@23f2000573</a><br>
But the problem is you had to submit the answer rounded off to 3 decimal places. A decimal more or less would result in a wrong answer.

Hello Sir"s, <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a>
I was able to successfully attempt only 5 questions within the time limit. But due to internet issues, I could not submit exactly at 1:45pm.<br>
My last submission was at 1:47pm. But if there was a auto save then you could already check my answers were in the portal.
I request you to please consider submission delays of 2-3 mins as this was due a technical glitches. And we too are switching tabs and running in vscode<br>

Hello  <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a><br>
<a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a> as I already showed you in the meet that while submitting it was already showing 10, and for surety and safety i clicked on SAVE Button, on resaving now it’s showing 0 and dint get submitted properly…

you have to filter students with marks 30 or more in maths not biology and then answer to question is total biology mark you have found the total maths mark

Hello <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> / <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a>
I  am Gudivada Abiram(21f3002158). In my today’s ROE exam I forgot to click the save button. My score initially was 6/10. I was tackling another question and by that time the timer went off. I can even send my answers if required.<br>
I should have submitted more frequently, but I was busy solving the other questions for extra marks.<br>
Could you please consider my request?<br>
Thank you.

Sir, I’m facing the same issue. While the recent scores say I have a score of 10, my final score shows 0. Kindly look into this, and please consider the highest marks from recent saves.<br>
Thank you.

The same happened to me before the exam. Fortunately, I saw it before, and charged my laptop.

[Link to Post](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/remote-online-exam-tds-jan-2025/602379)

Charging wasnt an issue for me, my entire vsc just froze and the screen went blank during the last 5 mins. That was exactly when i got the code for q6 and was trying to get the output and it froze, reopened at 1:45 and the time was up

Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/23f2000778">@23f2000778</a>
No need to worry about that, I have checked in backend your score is 10 of 10.
kind regards

Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/21f3002158">@21f3002158</a>
I looked for your result in backend, seems like you didn’t click to submit button throughout the exam.
Since roe exam portal was similar to GA’s where you need to save answers using save button, after saving only your answers get evaluated and you get answers.
There is no way other than pressing save button, we can’t do any help with this.
Kind regards

<a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a>  <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> sir,  I got disconnected at around 1:35 due to a network glitch and had to restart my uv server as well collab which wasted around 5 min and my score was around 7 and further I ran multiple scripts which I had already saved as code snippets as part of GA for question 4 on vs code and Collab and  finally got the answer but I exceeded the time limit since the submission I made was at 1:47:28 which was 9…so I request to please consider that<br>
Overall the ROE was a great experience and I wholly enjoyed the process

The questions were really similar to the GAs and mocks…I practiced them beforehand and had code snippets ready to use…so I guess that was helpful

[Link to Post](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/remote-online-exam-tds-jan-2025/602968)

Ok sir<br>
Also I have realised the value of 28 seconds since my last submission (9/10) was at 1:47:28<br>
I respect the rules of the exam and will be more careful in the future exams to avoid such technical glitches.

When I clicked the save button, it took an unusually long time to respond and eventually showed an error. There was no network issue, as other applications were working fine. However, the moment I clicked “Save,” all websites stopped loading, and my browser became unresponsive. I’m not sure what caused this problem, but I will share a screenshot to help diagnose the issue.<br>

I have attempted all the questions in the ROE and solved few of the questions but i forgot to save the submission. At that time, I did not realize that I have not even saved once during the time. After realizing that i have not saved it in the evening, I have used the console to disable the save and saved my answers. Is it possible to validate it? I don’t have any submissions before 1:45pm. I realize that it is my mistake for not being careful about it but i request sir to be lenient about it as the project 1 was also difficult and i have my exams tomorrow.<br>

Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/jayeshbansal">@Jayeshbansal</a>
Until not clicked on save button answers get’s checked at frontend side only. There is no way we can validate it after deadline.
I trust you would have solved few questions and also would have checked before deadline but clicking on save button was must to get submission evaluated.
Kind regards

[Link to Post](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/remote-online-exam-tds-jan-2025/602904)

i have not saved even once during the deadline but i have submitted/saved by hacking it in the evening when i realised that i have not saved it, i am asking you to consider that as i really don’t have any saves before deadline which will result me 0 marks, my request is to accept post deadline save by being lenient about it else i will get 0 marks. I will be satisfied even if you consider my 2nd save rather than latest save. (1st save was a sample test to check if possible, so it was 0 marks but the 2nd save is under 1-2 min which may prove that i have done all that questions before)

Hello sir, <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a><br>
Do you mean you will not consider them for evaluation then?

[Link to Post](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/remote-online-exam-tds-jan-2025/603005)

Yes, it won’t be considered.

[Link to Post](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/remote-online-exam-tds-jan-2025/603009)

yes, as you can see my first save is at 7:25 which was a trial check if post submission is working or not but you can see that the 2nd and 3rd are saved in approx 1 minute but i got 8 corrects which proves that i have done it before only. the latest save got 9 marks as i forgot to run the fastapi server for 1st mark which resulted me 3 more minutes. So, I request sir to consider any one of the saves except the first save

Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/23f3002537">@23f3002537</a><br>
The problem is that, here you are sending headers unnecessary and overwriting the original headers. Moreover you were returning the text of the response instead of the json. Here is the revised version.
<pre data-code-wrap="python"><code class="lang-python">from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import httpx
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

# Add CORS middleware to handle preflight OPTIONS requests
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

@app.get("/api")
async def proxy(url: str, request: Request):
    headers = {key: value for key, value in request.headers.items() if key.lower() != "host"}
    try:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(url)
            return response.json()
    except httpx.RequestError as e:

Hello <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> sir,
Will it be possible to consider only the minutes. I also cannot control the technical delays. I raised the point as fast as possible and I also joined the technical GMEET and exited when a different person raised the same question.
I would dearly propose to consider still 1:47. But if it’s 1:48 you can ofcourse not consider it. But the “seconds” is something unrealistic.
Please re consider this request sir.

I checked your submission, its at 1:47:30 PM. We are going to give a grace period of 2 minutes past 1:45 PM. Given that you submitted 30 seconds past 1:47, we won’t be able to consider it.<br>
Regards

[Link to Post](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/remote-online-exam-tds-jan-2025/603125)

Please reconsider this decision. In the heat of the moment, I failed to save. In my mind, I was sure that I had saved it. There is one other student with the same problem ( saved a few seconds after 1:47).
Since I did only one save, I would get zero marks if the score is not considered.
I didn’t submit any new answer after 1:45 pm.
Please reconsider if possible.

They only started pushing the scores a few minutes ago, so just wait for the update to finish. Check again and confirm after a few hours.
Thanks

Dont worry, we have the right scores on our server. There has been some problem in sending the export to the operations team. Your scores are safe. We are working on figuring out the problem. Even the bonus marks are recorded. Just give us a couple of days to sort it out. Many students have been affected so we cant give individual responses right now. Its a system fix that needs to be implemented.

Respected Sir,
I noticed that my status is still marked as absent. I understand I may be a bit impatient, but I wanted to clarify my submission. I had submitted the ROE on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed until 1:47 PM.
Even after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks when someone said that this term’s project was tougher than the last.
Even if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it’s my mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form. Since this is a standalone degree for me, I’m actually worried about it. When I learned how to unlock the ROE, I completed it in a very short time.
Please consider the top marks even when did after the normal deadline as marks still got submitted<br>

The latest submission before the deadline would be 3 marks. That is what would be considered.
